    <h2>Video Card: Character Generation</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The Odyssey video card runs at 640x480. The "brute force" approach to drawing stuff on the screen would be
    to designate a byte for each pixel. Each byte could contain color data (up to 256 colors). So that would
    require 307,200 bytes of RAM in the video card framebuffer. Not only is that more RAM than the video
    card has available, it's more RAM than the CPU can even address. Even if the CPU could address it all,
    and could update a byte every other clock cycle, the CPU running at 1MHz would require over 600ms to update
    the entire display. That would be far too slow to do much of anything useful. And consider that 600ms
    would be just raw updates to the display. If we used the CPU to draw the characters in a text display
    pixel-by-pixel, it would surely take dozens or even hundreds of clock cycles to update the frame buffer
    for every single character on the screen. So now you're talking about <i>seconds</i> of time just to
    update the display.
    </p>
    <p>
    How to solve this? Computers in the 70s and 80s and even 90s, got around this constraint by using
    <i>character generation</i> hardware. Instead of the CPU writing individual pixels to the video card's
    frame buffer, the CPU would write <i>characters</i>, and the video card would handle writing out the
    individual pixels. For the Odyssey video card, I've designated the top 4KiB of RAM (<tt>0x0000-0x0fff</tt>
    from the video card's perspective, or <tt>0x4000-0x4fff</tt> from the CPU's perspective) to the
    frame buffer. 64x64=4096. So I took the seemingly reasonable approach of having lines of 64 characters
    each. If each character is 8 pixels wide, that is 512 pixels, which will fit in a 640 pixel wide display
    with some letterboxing on either side. If each character is 8 pixels tall, that's also 512 pixels, which
    will not fit in 480 vertical pixels. So we can only fit 60 rows of characters.
    </p>
    <p>
    So we have a 64x60 grid of characters, arranged in RAM, from the video card's perspective, at
    <tt>0x0000-0xefff</tt>. Each byte in that range contains an ASCII character that the CPU is asking
    the video card to draw on our behalf. How do we do that in hardware?
    </p>
    <p>
    The trick is to use the horizontal and vertical counters (see 
    <a href="javascript:show_content('video-hsync-vsync')">Hsync &amp Vsync Generation</a>) as <i>addresses</i>
    into the RAM, as well as into a font ROM. This is straight out of the playbook for older ISA video
    cards of the 80s. It works by carefully mapping counters into the address pins.
    </p>

    <p>
    Imagine the electron beam scanning across a line of the display. As it scans along, the lowest
    three bits of <tt>HCOUNT</tt> (<tt>HCOUNT[2-0]</tt>) will always correspond to values 0-7. Similarly,
    as the electron beam moves down the lines of the display, the lowest three bits of <tt>VCOUNT</tt>)
    (<tt>VCOUNT[2-0]</tt>) will always correspond to values 0-7. So we can think of those bottom three
    bits as an index into the rows and columns describing a <i>bitmap</i> for a character:

    <table class="font-table">
    <tr>
      <td>V[0],H[0]</td>
      <td>V[0],H[1]</td>
      <th>V[0],H[2]</td>
      <th>V[0],H[3]</td>
      <td>V[0],H[4]</td>

      <th>V[1],H[3]</td>
      <th>V[1],H[4]</td>
      <td>V[1],H[5]</td>
      <td>V[1],H[6]</td>
      <td>V[1],H[7]</td>

    <tr>
      <th>V[4],H[0]</td>
      <th>V[4],H[1]</td>

      <th>V[4],H[3]</td>
      <th>V[4],H[4]</td>
      <th>V[4],H[5]</td>
      <td>V[4],H[6]</td>
      <td>V[4],H[7]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>V[5],H[0]</td>
      <th>V[5],H[1]</td>
      <td>V[5],H[2]</td>
      <td>V[5],H[3]</td>

    <tr>
      <th>V[6],H[0]</td>
      <th>V[6],H[1]</td>
      <td>V[6],H[2]</td>
      <td>V[6],H[3]</td>
      <th>V[6],H[4]</td>

    So what this means is that every 8th pixel that the electron beam comes across (whenever
    the last three bits of <tt>HCOUNT</tt> are <tt>0b000</tt>), we can load a new character
    from the framebuffer, and a new character bitmap from the font ROM. And the value of the
    last three bits of <tt>VCOUNT</tt> will tell us which row of the bitmap we need.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is how the horizontal and vertical counter bits are fed into the frame buffer RAM address:
    </p>
    <table class="bit-table">
    <tr>
      <th>11</td>
      <th>10</td>
      <th>9</td>
      <th>8</td>
      <th>7</td>
      <th>6</td>
      <th>5</td>
      <th>4</td>
      <th>3</td>
      <th>2</td>
      <th>1</td>
      <th>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan=6><tt>VCOUNT[8-3]</tt></td>
      <td colspan=6><tt>HCOUNT[8-3]</tt></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    The frame buffer RAM will return an 8-bit value (the ASCII character we want to draw) when
    this address is fed in. We can then feed <i>that</i> value, along with the last three bits
    of <tt>VCOUNT</tt>, into the font ROM:
    </p>

    <table class="bit-table">
    <tr>
      <th>10</td>
      <th>9</td>
      <th>8</td>
      <th>7</td>
      <th>6</td>
      <th>5</td>
      <th>4</td>
      <th>3</td>
      <th>2</td>
      <th>1</td>
      <th>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan=8><tt>ASCII_CHAR</tt></td>
      <td colspan=3><tt>VCOUNT[2-0]</tt></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    The output of the font ROM will be an 8-bit byte corresponding to the row of
    the bitmap for the ASCII character the electron beam is currently scanning over.
    </p>

    <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
    <p>
    Take a look at the block diagram below (click it to get the full size version).
    In the green box you'll find the character generation block diagram. Observe how
    we feed <tt>VCOUNT[8-3]</tt> and <tt>HCOUNT[8-3]</tt> into the RAM. The output of
    this is dropped into an 8-bit "character register", which stores the ASCII value
    of the current character we are drawing.  That value is then fed into the
    font ROM, along with <tt>VCOUNT[2-0]</tt>, to generate an 8-bit value, which is
    one row of a character's bitmap. That value is dumped into a <tt>74x166</tt>
    shift register, and every tick of the pixel clock, the next pixel value (on or off)
    is generated at the <tt>PIXEL_A</tt> signal.
    </p>
    <p>
    There's other logic in there too that deals with how to handle color and a cursor,
    but we'll talk about that in the next section.
    </p>

    <h3>How realistic is this really?</h3>
    <p>
    So is this really how video cards back in the 80s and 90s did things? Well, I can't
    say for sure, as I don't have insight into the actual implementations of old cards.
    But it's quite telling that if you go to <a href=https://int10h.org>int10h.org</a>
    and download ROM dumps for the 8x8 fonts, they are in precisely the same format
    as the Odyssey video card's font ROM. To me, that says the architecture is sufficiently
    similar to say that I've faithfully reproduced it. In fact, all the fonts that
    I currently use in the Odyssey video card are from <a href=https://int10h.org>int10h.org</a>,
    I literally just concatenated a bunch of the 8x8 font files and wrote them to
    an AT28C256 EEPROM and used it as my font ROM. I have some DIP switches that let
    me select the top four bits of the ROM, which lets me choose between up to sixteen
    different fonts without even resetting the computer. The fonts update on the display
    in real time as I flip the DIP switches. It's pretty slick.
