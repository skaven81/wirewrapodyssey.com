    <h2>Architecture: Transfer Registers</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    There are three "transfer" registers in the Odyssey CPU, 
    <tt class=register>TAL</tt>, and <tt class=register>TD</tt>.
    These registers are not intended to be used by userspace programs directly;
    the intended purpose of these registers is as a scratchpad for the microcode.
    </p>
    <p>
    Since these registers are meant to be (and are) used by the microcode,
    touching any of these registers in normal userspace programs can be
    dangerous. For example, this instruction sequence is dangerous:
    <code><pre>
    LD_TD 0xdead    # load byte at 0xdead into TD register
    JMP .location
    NOP
    .location
    ST_TD 0xbeef    # write byte in TD to 0xbeef
    </pre></code>
    At first glance it all seems fine -- a byte will be loaded into
    register, then we jump to another place in the code, where the byte in <tt class=register>TD</tt>
    is written to some other address.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is dangerous because the <tt>JMP</tt> instruction clobbers the the <tt class=register>TD</tt>
    register:
    <code><pre>
    [0x20] JMP @addr
    x 0 IncrementPC
    # PC now points to high byte of target address
    x 1 AddrBusPC WriteTD IncrementPC                     &lt;-- AIIEE!
    # TD now contains high byte of target address and
    # PC points to low byte of target address
    x 2 AddrBusPC WritePCL
    x 3 DataBusTD WritePCH
    x 4 NextInstruction
    </pre></code>
    That means when the <tt>ST_TD</tt> instruction comes along, <tt class=register>TD</tt>
    will contain the high byte of the target address of the <tt>JMP</tt>
    instruction, not the value loaded in the <tt>LD_TD</tt> instruction.
    </p>
    
    <h3>So why have opcodes that touch these registers?</h3>
    <p>
    One might similarly ask why John Carmack used the magic number <tt>0x5F3759DF</tt>
    in his infamous <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root>fast
    inverse square root</a> implementation, or why numerous Atari 2600 game developers
    had to do obscene things with the limited hardware they were given. The answer is,
    sometimes, it's OK (and even preferred) to use "dangerous" hardware features, if
    it results in simpler code, or faster code, or something like that.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the case of the Odyssey CPU, the transfer registers can be used safely if:
    <ol>
      <li>No opcodes that touch the transfer registers are used in between - this just means careful code design.</li>
      <li>Interrupts are disabled for the code block using the transfer registers - not only does handling
        an interrupt clobber the transfer registers, but code happening inside the interrupt handler
        is likely to do the same.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
