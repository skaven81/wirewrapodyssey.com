    <h2>Peripherals: 1MB Extended RAM</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The primary RAM for the Odyssey computer is a Renesas 7007 32KiB dual-port static RAM.
    8KiB of that address space is dedicated to the video card framebuffer, and 4KiB is tied
    up in various hard-coded memory regions such as the stack, heap, and keyboard and UART
    buffers. That only leaves 20KiB for programs to use. Once loading programs from removable
    media (or over serial) is implemented, that 20KiB also has to store the program being
    executed as well as the RAM that it needs to run. Obviously it's possible to do amazing
    things with less -- the Atari 2600 only had 128 bytes of RAM and 4KiB of ROM on the
    cartridge. The first TRS-80 had just 4KiB of RAM.
    </p>
    <p>
    But I'm not in the business of...well...business. I am not trying to keep BoM costs down
    so I can sell a computer at an affordable price. And therefore it's not really in my
    interest to spend a bunch of time doing hardcore optimization of my software to cram
    it all into a 20KiB memory footprint.
    </p>
    <p>
    And thus, I decided I wanted to have enough RAM to be able to code up whatever I wanted,
    without the need for crazy memory management tricks. Any time an algorithm can be
    made simpler by trading complexity or speed for RAM -- I should just use more RAM.
    For an eight bit system with a 64KiB total address space, 1MiB of RAM should be more
    than enough.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
    The approach I decided to take for the extended RAM is similar to many CPUs of the
    8-bit era. Rather than have the CPU address the whole available memory space directly,
    a "window" is provided to the extended RAM. In my case, I decided to provide two
    windows, one at <tt>0xd000-0xdfff</tt>, and another at <tt>0xe000-0xefff</tt>. Each
    of these 4KiB windows consume 12 bits of address space. If I bolt on an additional
    8 bits of address, well that's 20 bits, or 1MiB of addressable memory.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are two 8-bit extended memory window registers. The one providing the "D" window
    is accessed at <tt>0xc200</tt>, and the one providing the "E" window is accessed at
    <tt>0xc201</tt>. With an 8-bit value set in each of these registers, memory accesses
    to the <tt>0xdnnn</tt> simply concatenate the 8-bit window value with the lowest
    twelve bits of the CPU address bus. The resulting 20 bit address is fed to the RAM.

    <p>
    As you can see in the schematic above, while the concept sounds simple enough, actually
    implementing it took a lot more glue logic than I expected.
    </p>

    <h3>D/E Window Registers</h3>
    <p>
    Let's start with the D/E window registers. These are implemented as a pair of <tt>74x377</tt>
    8-bit D flip flops. The address decoder at the top of the page (the big 8-input NOR gate)
    generates a signal when the top eight bits of the address are <tt>0xc2</tt>. The least significant
    address line is then used to select between the D and E window register. So actually, any
    even address between <tt>0xc200-0xc2ff</tt> maps to the D window register, and any odd address
    maps to the E window register. The '377s are wired to the data bus so that when a write to
    that address writes the correct '377 by pulling the correct <tt>/WE</tt> pin low.
    </p>
    <p>
    The two window registers can be read as well, via the two <tt>74x245</tt> bus transceivers
    shown at the bottom of the page, as well as the two OR gates above them. If the CPU is reading
    <tt>0xc2nn</tt>, one of <tt>/SEGD_RD</tt> or <tt>/SEGE_RD</tt> will be pulled low, putting
    the correct window register's value on the data bus.
    </p>

    <h3>Extended RAM interface</h3>
    <p>
    With the window registers sorted, another address decoder is needed to see when the CPU is
    reading or writing in the <tt>0xdnnn</tt> or <tt>0xennn</tt> address space. The two NAND gates
    in the middle left accomplish this, generating <tt>/ADDR_D</tt> and <tt>/ADDR_E</tt> signals.
    These then go into an AND gate to generate a composite <tt>/ADDR_DE</tt> signal. These
    signals, along with a few more bits of glue logic, feed a pair of <tt>74x257</tt> 4-bit 2-to-1
    multiplexers. When the address bus is in the <tt>0xdnnn</tt> range, the D window register
    is on the outputs of the multiplexer. And when the address bus is in the <tt>0xennn</tt> range,
    the E window register is on the outputs of the multiplexer. We now have the top eight bits
    of our address, and the address bus provides the lower twelve bits.
    </p>
    <p>
    But here it gets complicated again! The extended RAM is not a single 1MiB chip. It's a pair
    of 512KiB chips (<tt>AS6C4008</tt> to be precise). These are standard RAM devices, with a
    19 bit address bus, and the usual set of <tt>/CE</tt>, <tt>/OE</tt> and <tt>/WE</tt> pins.
    The 20th address bit can be used as a toggle between the two RAM chips, with a little glue
    logic.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <tt>/CE</tt> (chip enable) is asserted on <i>both</i> RAMs any time a read or write
    is happening in the <tt>0xdnnn</tt> or <tt>0xennn</tt> range. For reads (when the CPU's
    <tt>/WRAM</tt> is high) the 19-bit address is fed into both RAMs and the right chip's
    <tt>/OE</tt> (output enable) is pulled low based on the value of the 20th address bit.
    For writes, <tt>/WE</tt> (write enable) is pulled low on the right chip based on the
    value of the 20th address bit.
    </p>

    <h3>Fixing some timing glitches</h3>
    <p>
    When I first implemented the extended RAM, it would not work reliably and in fact caused the
    whole computer to become unstable when plugged in. Some troubleshooting with my logic
    analyzer in timing mode, showed that any time the address bus was in the extended RAM
    window (which could happen a lot during transitions from low address values back to an
    idle address bus at <tt>0xffff</tt>), the <tt>/OE</tt> pin on one of the RAMs would get
    pulled low for a moment. This would cause contention on the data bus.
    </p>
    <p>
    The fix was to add an OR gate that prevents the <tt>/OE</tt> pin from being pulled low
    until the back half of the clock cycle. That's the hand-drawn <tt>/OE_OK</tt> signal
    I added in there. This ensures that when a new opcode is presented, that the address
    bus is given half a clock cycle to stabilize, before allowing <tt>/OE</tt> to be
    asserted on either RAM. A similar construct was already in place for the <tt>/WE</tt>
    pin, because the RAM's timing requirements dictate that <tt>/CE</tt> must be low
    and <tt>/OE</tt> must be high, before <tt>/WE</tt> is pulled low to initiate a write
    cycle. Also, it is important that the address and data buses be stable before pulling
    <tt>/WE</tt> low.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is one of those situations where having a two phase clock would have come in handy,
    as I could have used the phasing to delay the <tt>/OE</tt> and <tt>/WE</tt> transitions
    to nearly the end of the clock cycle and thus increase the overall clock speed. But
    for now, this solution works for up to around 2MHz or so. I could get a little more
    speed by replacing the <tt>74HC</tt> chips that do address decoding, with <tt>74A</tt>
    series chips, which have MUCH faster propagation delay.
    </p>

    <h3>Software</h3>
    <p>
    It was important to me that I be able to verify that all the 1MiB of RAM was properly
    accessible, and that I didn't have any glitches like a mis-wired address pin that
    would cause the wrong RAM chip to be written or read for a given address. To that
    end, I did some research on how RAM testers do this, and wrote a
    <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/os_shell/memtest/20-cmd_memtest.asm>
    shell command</a> that runs a comprehensive memory test. It uses the tried-and-true method
    of reading and writing <tt>0x55</tt> and <tt>0xaa</tt> values to each address, to check
    for any stuck bits or mis-wired data lines. It then runs a check of the window logic,
    by writing the window ID (<tt>0x00-0xff)</tt>) to the first and last byte of each page.
    These are then read back in the other window (e.g. write to D window, read back from E window)
    to make sure that both windows are operating correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
    Fortunately, the memory tests all seem to come back fine. I added a faster version
    of the test to the <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/os_shell/00-main.asm#L61>
    boot sequence</a>, which helps to ensure all the interconnect cables are firmly seated
    when booting the system. It's also fun to watch 1024KiB of RAM get checked during boot,
    it's reminisicent of my old 8088, 386, and 486 PCs booting up.
