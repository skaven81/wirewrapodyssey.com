    <h2>Peripherals Overview</h2>
    <p>
    The Wire Wrap Odyssey computer implements a simple memory-mapped peripheral model.
    Peripherals connect to the CPU's address and data bus, and can use the <tt class=register>/WRAM</tt>
    control signal to determine if data is being read from or written to addresses that
    the peripheral "owns". The peripheral may also pull an IRQ line low to signal the CPU
    for service.
    </p>
    <p>
    Unlike a modern computer, peripherals in the Wire Wrap Odyssey are not dynamically
    added and removed. They are hard-wired into the CPU itself (more like a microcontroller's
    peripherals than a PC's peripherals). Drivers are implemented as part of the OdysseyOS
    and memory ranges are hard-coded.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Wire Wrap Odyssey has several functional peripherals today, with more on the way.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('periph-kb')">PS/2 Keyboard</a> - An ATtiny microcontroller
        combined with some shift registers and glue logic allow for a simple interface to a PS/2
        keyboard, without the OS having to perform scancode translation.</li>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('periph-timer')">Realtime Clock and Timer</a> - A Maxim DS1511Y
        (which is a clone of the ubiquitous Dallas RTC) provides clock and timer duties. The
        DS1511Y also has a 256 byte battery-backed SRAM that can be used to store settings that
        persist across reboots (in the early x86 computers, this is where the BIOS settings
        were stored).</li>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('periph-serial')">RS232 UART</a> - An 82C52 UART
        provides a single RS232 serial port capable of up to 115200 baud. This old chip (designed
        to be paired with the 8086) was chosen over the more popular 16550 UART, as the 82C52
        requires a much smaller board footprint.</li>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('periph-extram')">1MB Extended RAM</a> - Two blocks
        of the memory range, <tt>0xd000-0xdffff</tt> and <tt>0xe000-0xefff</tt> are mapped to
        a 1MiB extended memory. Two 8-bit registers provide the top eight bits of the address
        used when reading or writing from <tt>0xd</tt> or <tt>0xe</tt> addresses, while the
        lower twelve bits come from the CPU address bus. Having two configurable "windows" into
        the same 1MiB of extended RAM makes for some interesting possibilities.</li>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('periph-ata')">ATA Port</a> - Not yet implemented,
        but planned for 2024. The original ATA bus specification is simple enough that it can
        be implemented with some glue logic. The main complication is that reads and writes
        are all with 16-bit data values. But once implemented, it should be possible to read
        and write from essentially any ATA-compliant device, such as compact flash cards
        and even old hard drives.</li>
    </ul>
