    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
    The Odyssey computer is far, FAR from perfect. It was built (intentionally) in
    an <i>ad-hoc</i> manner, without much in the way of a high-level plan for how
    things would all work together, or for how to go from hardware to an OS to
    working software. There are many places where if I were doing it over again,
    I'd choose to implement things differently.
    </p>

    <h3>Video Card</h3>
    <h4>Allow for background color</h4>
    <p>
    If I were doing it again, I'd ditch the "blink" bit in the color byte, and instead have
    the color byte formatted like this:
    </p>
    <table class="bit-table">
    <tr>
      <th>7</td>
      <th>6</td>
      <th>5</td>
      <th>4</td>
      <th>3</td>
      <th>2</td>
      <th>1</td>
      <th>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan=1>crsr</td>
      <td colspan=1>back-R</td>
      <td colspan=1>back-G</td>
      <td colspan=1>back-B</td>
      <td colspan=1>bright</td>
      <td colspan=1>fore-R</td>
      <td colspan=1>fore-G</td>
      <td colspan=1>fore-B</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    This would give me 16 foreground colors (8 basic colors with a dim and bright variant
    of each) along with 8 background colors, and a bit to set for drawing a cursor.
    </p>
    <p>
    It would have been a pretty easy thing to do when I was building the video card. But
    for some reason I had it in my head that having support for 64 foreground colors and
    only black as a background color, would be sufficient. But I should have emulated the
    multitude of color 8-bit computers of the day, which all had support for background
    colors!
    </p>

    <h4>Graphics mode</h4>
    <p>
    It would have been quite a bit more work, but it would have been nice to implement
    a proper graphics mode in the video card as well. Today the video card can <i>only</i>
    draw characters in 8x8 pixel blocks. This requires 4KiB RAM for the character array
    and 4KiB for the color array, for a 64x64 grid of 8x8 pixel characters (the last four
    lines are hidden). If I took that same 8KiB of RAM and implemented something like
    CGA's palette-based 4-color system, I could define the color of each pixel with
    two bits, and so each byte could store four pixels. With 8KiB RAM, that's enough for
    32K pixels. A 160x120 pixel display (a quarter of 640x480), is 19,200 pixels, and
    so would fit in memory.
    </p>
    <p>
    But the more I thought about it, I considered that I could actually do at least as
    good as that, with more colors, with a software overlay on top of character mode.
    Consider the 160x120 pixel setup. Each "pixel" is four "real" pixels wide and four
    "real" pixels tall. So that means each 8x8 character block hold four "pixels".
    That is only sixteen combinations. A font could be burned to the font ROM that
    enumerates all sixteen of these combinations as glyphs, then software could handle
    updating each character to the right glyph when a "pixel" is written. The chief
    downside to this approach is that all four "pixels" would have to be the same color,
    as they're part of the same glyph.
    </p>

    <h4>Full width display</h4>
    <p>
    When I designed the video card I thought that I was doing myself a favor by using
    only power-of-two quantities for things like the character size (8x8) and the
    character and color arrays (64x64). But this turned out to be pretty limiting
    in the end. My display can draw 64x60 characters, which is technically more data
    than a typical 80x25 terminal, but 64 characters is not a lot of width to work
    with. I totally understand now why the 80 character wide terminal stuck around
    for so long -- it's <i>just</i> wide enough. 64 is just too narrow.
    </p>
    <p>
    I do still think that my choice to go with 8x8 characters was the right one. A
    640x480 resolution thus yields 80x60 characters, or 4,800 bytes for the characters.
    This spills over the 4KiB boundary, but I'm sure that with some additional work
    I could have made the video card handle it just fine. It would just make the
    address ranges a little more awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
    And it turns out that being able to move an address around the display by just
    flipping bits, has been of very little utlity, when compared to how limiting
    the 64-character-wide display is. I mean, it makes the computer scientist in
    me grin when I observe that on a 64x60 array, moving around just requires simple
    bit flips. But in practice, that's now how those operations happen. Instead, they're
    done with addition and subtraction:
    <ul>
        <li>Cursor left: <tt>$addr - 0x0001</tt></li>
        <li>Cursor right: <tt>$addr + 0x0001</tt></li>
        <li>Cursor up: <tt>$addr - 0x0040</tt></li>
        <li>Cursor down: <tt>$addr + 0x0040</tt></li>
        <li>Char addr to Color addr: <tt>$addr + 0x1000</tt>
        <li>Color addr to Char addr: <tt>$addr - 0x1000</tt>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Who cares if cursor up/down uses <tt>0x50</tt> (80) instead of <tt>0x40</tt> (64)?
    And who cares if converting an address between colors and chars uses <tt>0x12c0</tt>
    instead of <tt>0x1000</tt>? I thought that using power-of-two would simplify these
    sorts of operations, but it's all the same ADD/SUB operations either way. So I
    should have just gone with the "non-aligned" memory map and made an 80x60 terminal work.
    </p>

    <h3>CPU &amp; Instruction Set</h3>
    <h4>More ALU-accessible Registers</h4>
    <p>
    The Odyssey CPU has eight total registers, but only four of those are plumbed to
    the ALU. The C and D register pairs can helpfully do 16-bit increment and decrement
    operations, but they lack the ALU flags (overflow, equal, zero) and so the increment/
    decrement operations must always be backed by some sort of counter in the A or B
    registers to keep track of how far through the process you are.
    </p>
    <p>
    If I were to do it again, I'd plumb all four 16-bit register pairs (A, B, C, D)
    to the ALU. This would provide for a more symmetrical instruction set architecture,
    double the "scratchpad" size for more complex algorithms, and make it much easier
    to perform long loops that require more than 8 bits of counter.
    </p>
    <p>
    I would also implement all of the registers the way I did with C and D, so that
    16-bit increment and decrement operations could be performed without the ALU, and
    make it so that each increment/decrement operation sets the ALU flags.
    </p>

    <h4>Ensure all registers can write directly to data bus</h4>
    <p>
    When I was implementing the ALU, I thought I was being clever by not providing a
    way for the A and B registers to write directly to the data bus. If I needed
    any of those registers to write to the data bus, I could just execute an ALU
    operation (all ALU operations output to the data bus). A simple "identity" ALU
    operation would be sufficient to put the value on the data bus.
    </p>
    <p>
    But what this did was to create an asymmetry in how the A/B and C/D registers
    are accessed and used. For example, to push any of the C/D registers onto
    the stack, it's <tt>PUSH_CL</tt> or <tt>PUSH_DH</tt>.  But for A/B these
    require ALU operations: <tt>ALUOP_PUSH %A%+%AL%</tt> or <tt>ALUOP_PUSH %B%+%BH%</tt>.
    Improving the assembler hide this asymmetry can help somewhat, but the fact
    remains that <tt>PUSH_CL</tt> only takes 3 clocks, while <tt>ALUOP_PUSH<tt> takes
    4 (and an extra byte of data in the program). Not a huge deal, but it does mean
    that for tight loops where every clock tick counts, I have to consider whether
    the data should go into the C/D registers versus the A/B ones (and then also
    consider that C/D don't have access to the ALU!).
    </p>
    <p>
    If all eight registers could go to the ALU <i>or</i> the data bus, then
    I'd get the best of both worlds: simple data movement commands like <tt>PUSH</tt>
    and <tt>POP</tt> and <tt>MOV</tt> could be done on all registers in equal
    and minimal time. While still allowing everything to use the ALU.
    </p>

    <h3>OS Library / BIOS</h3>
    <h4>Terminal interface</h4>
    <p>
    The terminal I/O is where I've really butchered the code the most. It was built
    up in tiny, disparate pieces without much in the way of coordinating behavior
    or providing a clean and consistent API for programs to use. After all, the video
    card was the first thing I built, and so code to do things like manipulate the
    cursor, print text, and scroll the display, were some of the first libraries I
    wrote, long before I had even considered how the OS, shell, and additional software
    would interface with it.
    </p>
    <p>
    If I were to go back and write it again, I would start from the perspective of
    a terminal emulator. Basically just have the BIOS implement a software version
    of something like a VT220 terminal. Programs could interface to the display
    using a simple buffer -- just append characters to the buffer and the OS takes
    care of printing them to the display. ANSI escape sequences would allow for
    moving the cursor around, changing colors, and clearing the screen. Programs
    would always have the option to bypass the terminal library by writing directly
    to the video card framebuffer, which would be how things like games would work.
