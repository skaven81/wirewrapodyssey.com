    <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>

    <p>
    The Wire Wrap Odyssey is an 8-bit microcoded CPU with a 16-bit address bus.
    It is built primarily from 7400-series logic (mostly <tt>HC</tt> series).
    The diagram below shows the major components of the CPU and its peripherals.
    Arrows indicate data flow direction.  For example, the 8-bit <tt class=register>TD</tt> register
    can be presented to the data bus, and can read from the data bus, but it has
    no connection to the address bus.  The 16-bit <tt class=register>C</tt> register
    (composed of the 8-bit <tt class=register>CH</tt> and <tt class=register>CL</tt>
    registers), can put its value on the address bus, as well as the data bus. The
    <tt class=register>CH</tt> and <tt class=register>CL</tt> registers can be set
    from the data bus as well.  The <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> marks indicate that this
    register is composed of counters, so the value of the register can be incremented
    or decremented without involving the ALU.

    <h3>Address and Data Bus</h3>
    <p>
    The address and data buses are passive, with 330 ohm pullup resistors.  The low
    value for the pullup resistors is to enable higher clock speeds (at the expense
    of more power consumption).  With 330 ohm resistors and <tt>HC</tt> logic, the
    Wire Wrap Odyssey CPU can run stably at around 2.5MHz.
    </p>

    <h3>ROM</h3>
    <p>
    The ROM is an <tt>AT28C256</tt> 32KiB EEPROM. Only the first 16KiB of the EERPOM
    is used, and a DIP switch allows selecting between the lower and upper 16KiB.
    The ROM control logic pulls its <tt>/OE</tt> low when the first two bits of the
    address are <tt>0b00</tt>.
    </p>

    <h3>RAM</h3>
    <p>
    The primary RAM is a Renesas 7007 32KiB dual-port static RAM. This is a marked
    departure from the rest of the CPU which uses mostly parts from the '70s and '80s.
    But the advantages in performance and ease of design were too much to pass up.
    The dual-port RAM allows the video card to constantly read, and for the CPU to
    write, without the two having to coordinate with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first 8KiB of the RAM's address space is reserved for the video card, and
    the last 4KiB is reserved for system functions like the stack, heap, and buffers
    for the UART and keyboard.  The remaining 20KiB is available for application
    use. The Odyssey OS includes a primitive but functional <tt>malloc</tt> implementation
    that allows for RAM to be allocated dynamically from this 20KiB range.  Larger
    data sets can be manipulated using the 1MiB extended RAM peripheral, which is
    visible through a pair of configurable 4KiB windows.
    </p>

    <h3>Program Counter</h3>
    <p>
    The program counter <tt class=register>PC</tt> is built up from four <tt>74x161</tt>
    four-bit synchronous counters. Data can be loaded into <tt class=register>PCL</tt>
    and <tt class=register>PCH</tt> from the data bus (used for jump instructions) and
    can be incremented (16-bits wide) without needing the ALU.
    </p>

    <h3>Tranfer Registers</h3>
    <p>
    The <tt class=register>TAH</tt>, <tt class=register>TAL</tt>, and <tt class=register>TD</tt>
    registers are used within microcoded instructions to move data around, without
    interfering with program data. Some instructions do allow direct manipulation of these
    registers, but such instructions must be used carefully, as the data stored in these
    registers can be wiped out by executing an instruction that uses them.
    </p>

    <h3>Arithmetic Logic Unit</h3>
    <p>
    The ALU is a custom design based around a lookup table.  Two <tt>AT28C256</tt> EEPROMs
    are flashed in such a way that each behaves as a 4-bit ALU.  The two ALUs are combined
    to create an 8-bit sliced ALU.  Only the <tt class=register>A</tt> and <tt class=register>B</tt>
    registers can route data through the ALU.  The ALU can only write to the data bus.
    The <tt class=register>A</tt> and <tt class=register>B</tt> registers cannot write to
    the data bus directly; an ALU operation must route their data to the bus.  However, these
    registers can be presented to the address bus without an ALU operation.
    </p>
    <p>
    The ALU supports 32 instructions, including basic arithmetic, logic, and shifting
    operations.  There are also some special instructions for setting and clearing specific
    bits that make manipulating the video display easier. Since the ALU is just a pair of
    EEPROMs, instructions can be added or removed in the future as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Every ALU operation writes three status flags to a status register: <tt>Z</tt> (result
    of last operation was zero), <tt>E</tt> (the two operands were equal), and <tt>O</tt>
    (the result of the last operation set the carry-out bit, e.g. overflow).
    </p>

    <h3>C and D Registers</h3>
    <p>
    The 16-bit <tt class=register>C</tt> and <tt class=register>D</tt> registers (each comprised
    of 8-bit high and low registers) are built up from <tt>74x191</tt> up-down counters.
    This allows their value to be loaded from the data bus, and then once set, be incremented
    or decremented (across the full 16-bit value) without involving the ALU.  This helps to
    optimize operations where data is being examined or copied between two regions of memory,
    as the "to" and "from" addresses can live in <tt class=register>C</tt> and <tt class=register>D</tt>,
    and the program can easily move through series of addresses without having to shuffle
    registers around to involve the ALU. They also serve as overflow storage when the four
    ALU registers are insufficient.
    </p>

    <h3>Instruction Sequencing</h3>
    <p>
    Instructions are represented as anonymous 8-bit values.  Thus there are 256
    possible opcodes.  None of the opcode bits are used directly to influence
    the control logic.  Instead, the opcode is concatenated with the ALU
    <tt class=register>FLAGS</tt> and a 4-bit <tt class=register>SEQUENCE</tt>
    counter, to create a 15-bit value.  This value is fed to the address pins
    of four <tt>AT28C256</tt> EEPROMs, which then emit 32 control signals.
    Software is used to compile the four control ROM images.  The result is a
    Turing-machine-like state machine, where the next state (and thus the next
    value presented to the control ROM address inputs) is derived from the
    current state.  The sequence counter always increments by one every clock
    tick.  A control signal can reset the sequence counter to zero, which
    terminates the current instruction. It is nearly always paired with control
    signals to write the next opcode into the <tt class=register>OPCODE</tt>
    register.
    </p>

    <h3>Interrupt Handling</h3>
    <p>
    Peripherals can pull one of eight interrupt lines low (they are all held
    high with pull-up resistors).  The interrupt lines go into a <tt>74x148</tt>
    priority encoder.  When any interrupt line is pulled low, the IRQ Pending
    signal will be asserted.  If this signal is asserted, and interrupts are
    enabled (not masked), then the next time the <tt class=register>OPCODE</tt>
    register is written, instead of the value coming from the data bus being used,
    the static value <tt>0xEE</tt> is written instead.  The actual interrupt
    handling is then performed by microcode.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <tt>IRQ</tt> opcode masks interrupts and saves the current value of the <tt class=register>PC</tt>
    and <tt class=register>D</tt> to the stack, writes <tt class=register>IRQVEC</tt>
    (<tt>0x5f</tt>) to <tt class=register>DH</tt>, and <tt class=register>IRQID</tt>
    (the 3-bit IRQ number, shifted left one bit) to <tt class=regiser>DL</tt>.
    <tt class=register>D</tt> is presented to the address bus, and the resulting
    byte on the data bus is written to <tt class=register>PCH</tt>.  Then <tt class=register>D</tt>
    is incremented, and the operation is done again, with the new byte written
    to the <tt class=register>PCL</tt> register.  <tt class=register>D</tt> is restored
    from the stack, and the opcode at <tt class=register>PC</tt> is loaded into
    <tt class=register>OPCODE</tt>, and operation continues.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <tt>RETI</tt> instruction reverses this operation, restoring <tt class=register>PC</tt>
    from the stack, loading <tt class=register>OPCODE</tt> from the address in
    <tt class=register>PC</tt>, unmasking interrupts, and resuming operation.
    </p>
    <p>
    By microcoding the interrupt handler, it makes programming custom interrupt
    handlers easy.  The software just needs to write an interrupt vector address
    to <tt>0x5fnn</tt>. When that interrupt is triggered, the CPU will jump
    directly to that address, with interrupts masked, and begin executing. The
    interrupt handler is responsible for servicing the peripheral (such that it
    stops asserting its interrupt line) then terminates with a <tt>RETI</tt>
    instruction and control is seamlessly returned to the main program.
    </p>

    <h3>Video Card</h3>
    <p>
    The video card is attached to the "left" side of the 32KiB dual-port RAM (the CPU
    uses the "right" side).  The video card outputs a VGA 640x480 video signal and displays
    a 64x60 grid of 8x8 pixel characters.  There is no support for direct graphics, it
    is only a character display.
    </p>
    <p>
    The video card maps the top 4KiB (minus 256 bytes) to the characters in the 64x60 grid.
    Character glyphs use the classic DOS codepage 437 character set, and are pulled directly
    from the archives at <a href="https://int10h.org">int10h</a>. DIP switches on the video
    card allow for selection from 16 fonts, and can be selected with the computer online
    and running.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second 4KiB of the dual-port RAM (minus 256 bytes) is used for storing color data.
    Six-bit color is used, with two bits each for red, green, and blue intensity, for a total
    of 64 available colors.  The remaining two bits are for making that character blink, or
    have a blinking cursor drawn on it. This has the unusual side effect that multiple cursors
    (or cursors wider than one character) may be drawn.
    </p>

    <h3>Peripherals</h3>
    <p>
    Peripherals are handled through memory mapping and interrupts.  Peripherals may
    only interact with the address bus (read), the data bus (read and write) and
    the <tt>/WRAM</tt> (write RAM), <tt>CLK</tt>, <tt>/CLK</tt>, and <tt>RST</tt>
    control signals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Typical operation of an Odyssey peripheral is to "listen" to some address(es)
    in the <tt>0xcnnn</tt> address space. Reading or writing these addresses will
    usually read or write a register in the peripheral, and is often the trigger
    to make the peripheral stop asserting its interrupt line.  Data can be read from
    and written to the peripheral by reading and writing to specific memory addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently the Odyssey has five peripherals:
    <ul>
    <li>PS/2 Keyboard controller</li>
    <li><tt>DS1511Y+</tt> Real Time Clock and timer (also contains a 256 byte battery-backed static RAM)
    <li><tt>82C52</tt> UART
    <li>1MB extended RAM</li>
    <li>ATA port</li>
    </ul>
    Additional peripherals are planned, such as a programmable timer interrupt system
    and an FM synthesis sound chip.
