    <h2>Architecture: Interrupt Handler</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The ability to handle interrupts is a crucial feature that separates "toy"
    CPUs from "usable" ones. Let's look at the simplest example of keyboard
    or serial input. Without interrupts, the CPU must constantly poll the keyboard
    hardware to see if a new keystroke is available for processing, and if so,
    branch to a block of code that can retrieve the keystroke and process it.
    But who knows what programs might be doing at any given time on the CPU?
    What if the CPU is busy doing some intense computation that is going to
    take several hundred milliseconds to complete? Or what if the author of the
    currently-running program didn't include the code to poll the keyboard?
    Then it's possible that keystrokes may be missed, or even if not missed,
    there may be an unacceptable latency between keystrokes and something
    happening onscreen.
    </p>
    <p>
    But with interrupts, the software doesn't have to know or care at all what
    is happening with the keyboard or UART or any other devices. It can just
    do its normal work. In the event that the user strikes a key, or a new
    byte arrives on the serial interface, the device just flags an interrupt,
    and the normal flow of program execution is <i>interrupted</i> and the
    interrupt <i>handler</i> takes care of servicing the device (in the case
    of a serial or keyboard input, the incoming byte is likely appended to
    a buffer so the hardware is free to receive the next byte).  Then control
    is returned back to the original program, which continues completely unaware
    that it was even interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another good use case for handling interrupts is a timer. Say you are writing
    a game, and need the play field and/or player sprites to update at a predictable
    speed, perhaps 25 updates per second (once every 40ms). Without interrupts,
    you would need to know the CPU's clock speed, and the number of clock ticks
    that every instruction requires, and do laborious work to make sure every code
    path taken during every update, takes nearly exactly 40ms. Much of that time
    would likely be spent in a "stall" loop just waiting for the next frame to
    be rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
    But with a CPU that can handle interrupts, and timer hardware that can generate
    an interrupt regularly, the code becomes far more manageable. Just write the
    "screen refresh" code as an interrupt handler, and set the timer interrupt to
    fire every 40ms. Now the game will run at a consistent 25fps regardless of the
    CPU's clock speed, and there is no more need to insert specialized delay loops.
    </p>

    <h3>The Odyssey Interrupt System</h3>
    <p>
    Older CPUs like the 8086 and Z80 have a single interrupt pin: external hardware
    is required for the CPU to be able to accept multiple interrupts, and the operating
    system needs to be programmed to know how to differentiate between different
    interrupt sources.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Odyssey CPU takes a similar approach. There is one main <tt>IRQOP</tt> control
    signal, which if asserted, causes the CPU to load opcode <tt>0xEE</tt> (IRQ) instead
    of whatever opcode is currently referenced at the program counter location.
    </p>
    <p>
    To handle multiple interrupts, a <tt>74x148</tt> priority encoder is used. This chip
    is sort of like an 8-to-3 multiplexer, but having multiple inputs asserted simultaneously
    is valid. The priority encoder will set the 3 output bits in a predictable way, such
    that if multiple inputs are asserted, the one with the highest priority appears on
    the outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
    The priority encoder allows for up to eight devices to asynchronously assert an
    IRQ signal, and the <tt>74x148</tt> even conveniently has a single output pin that
    is asserted if any of the inputs are asserted -- this gets wired directly to the
    CPU's <tt>IRQOP</tt> control signal.  The three encoded priority lines are made
    available on the data bus via another control signal, so that the <tt>IRQOP</tt>
    instruction is able to determine which of the eight IRQs it is handling (and thus
    runs the correct handler code).
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
    Once an interrupt is asserted, the microcode for the <tt>0xEE</tt> (IRQ) opcode
    takes care of actually handling the interrupt:
    </p>

    <code><pre>
    [0xee] IRQ
    # PC is still pointing at our return address, as
    # the 0xee op was forced in instead of the intended
    # next instruction.
    x 0 MaskInterrupts IncrementSP
    # Write PC to stack
    x 1 AddrBusSP DataBusPCL WriteRAM IncrementSP
    x 2 AddrBusSP DataBusPCH WriteRAM IncrementSP
    # Save D register to stack
    x 3 AddrBusSP DataBusDH WriteRAM IncrementSP
    x 4 AddrBusSP DataBusDL WriteRAM
    # Load IRQ vec constant to DH
    x 5 DataBusIrqBase WriteDH
    # Load IRQ ID (shifted left one) to DL
    x 6 DataBusIrqId WriteDL
    # Load RAM@D into PC
    x 7 AddrBusD WritePCH
    x 8 IncrementD
    x 9 AddrBusD WritePCL
    # Pop D from stack
    x a AddrBusSP WriteDL DecrementSP
    x b AddrBusSP WriteDH DecrementSP
    # Execute referenced instruction
    x c NextInstruction
    </pre></code>

    <p>
    And at the end of the interrupt handler, a special <tt>RETI</tt> instruction
    is provided to return from the interrupt handler:
    </p>

    <code><pre>
    [0x03] RETI
    x 0 AddrBusSP WritePCH DecrementSP UnmaskInterrupts
    x 1 AddrBusSP WritePCL DecrementSP RestoreStatusFlags WriteStatus
    x 2 NextInstruction
    </pre></code>

    <h3>Interrupt vectors</h3>
    <p>
    Observe in the <tt>IRQ</tt> listing above, that micro-op 5 loads a constant into <tt class=register>DH</tt>.
    This constant is <tt>0x5f</tt>. Then micro-op 6 loads the IRQ ID into <tt class=register>DL</tt>.
    The IRQ ID is just the three bits coming from the priority encoder, wired up to bits 3, 2, and 1 of the
    data bus. Bits 7, 6, 5, 4, and 0 are all zero. So if <tt>IRQ0</tt> is asserted, the priority encoder
    output will be <tt>0b000</tt> and the resulting value in <tt class=register>D</tt> will be <tt>0x5f00</tt>.
    If <tt>IRQ1</tt> is asserted, the priority encoder output will be <tt>0b001</tt> and the resulting value
    in <tt class=register>D</tt> will be <tt>0x5f02</tt> (because the IRQ ID is shifted left one bit). This
    results in the following table of addresses that are loaded into <tt class=register>D</tt> for each interrupt
    line:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>IRQ0 - 0x5f00</tt></li>
      <li><tt>IRQ1 - 0x5f02</tt></li>
      <li><tt>IRQ2 - 0x5f04</tt></li>
      <li><tt>IRQ3 - 0x5f06</tt></li>
      <li><tt>IRQ4 - 0x5f08</tt></li>
      <li><tt>IRQ5 - 0x5f0a</tt></li>
      <li><tt>IRQ6 - 0x5f0c</tt></li>
      <li><tt>IRQ7 - 0x5f0e</tt></li>
    </ul>
    The data at <tt class=register>D</tt> is loaded into <tt class=register>PCH</tt> and then <tt class=register>D</tt>
    is incremented. The byte at that address is then loaded into <tt class=register>PCL</tt>. The opcode
    at <tt class=register>PC</tt> is then loaded and execution continues.
    </p>
    <p>
    The result of this mechanism is that there are eight separate interrupt vectors configurable in the
    Odyssey CPU. When the keyboard controller requests an interrupt (IRQ1), the CPU will jump to whatever
    subroutine is referenced at <tt>0x5f02-0x5f03</tt>. This can be (and is) an entirely different handler
    from the timer (IRQ3).
    </p>

    <h3>Masking interrupts</h3>
    <p>
    It is not safe to come out of reset with interrupts enabled, because if any of the interrupt lines
    are asserted, the CPU will attempt to handle the interrupt, before the handler addresses have been
    installed at <tt>0x5f00-0x5f0f</tt>. It is also a good idea to prevent interrupts from firing while
    the CPU is busy handling an interrupt - it allows for interrupt handling code to be simpler and safer.
    </p>
    <p>
    Two control signals, <tt>MASKINT</tt> and <tt>UMASKINT</tt>, are wired to a J-K flip-flop, so that
    micro-ops in <tt>IRQ</tt>, <tt>RETI</tt>, <tt>MASKINT</tt> and <tt>UMASKINT</tt> opcodes are able to
    set and reset the <tt>IRQMASK</tt> control signal in software. When interrupts are masked, the
    instruction handling circuitry is blocked from loading the <tt>0xee</tt> IRQ opcode, even if the
    <tt>IRQOP</tt> control signal is asserted.
    </p>

    <h3>Returning safely from interrupt handler</h3>
    <p>
    When I first built the interrupt handling circuitry as described above, I found shortly afterward
    that my software started failing in really weird ways. After some painstaking debugging with
    the logic analyzer, I discovered that the problem was with returning from the interrupt handler
    safely. Here's the unsafe series of events that caused the problem:
    <ol>
      <li>ALU opcode executes, sets status flags</li>
      <li>IRQ opcode executes, as IRQ was requested during previous instruction</li>
      <li>During interrupt handler, some other ALU opcode was executed, changing the status flags</li>
      <li>Return from interrupt handler</li>
      <li>Branch instruction executes, expecting status flags to be set from ALU opcode in #1, but instead finds status flags from #3</li>
    </ol>
    I needed a way to preserve the status flags during interrupt handler execution, and restore
    them during the <tt>RETI</tt> instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
    My solution to this was a bit of a hack, but it works. In the notes above, notice the hand-drawn
    logic in the lower-right. This is the status flag preservation system.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Normal operation</b> - <tt>IRQMASK=0</tt> (interrupts are enabled) and <tt>STRES=0</tt>
        (not in <tt>RETI</tt> instruction): When ALU operations write the status register, the flags
        are written to both sides of the status register (bits 7, 6, and 5 are the "backup" status bits).
        </li>
      <li><b>IRQ handling</b> - <tt>IRQMASK=1</tt> (interrupts are disabled) and <tt>STRES=0</tt>
        (not in <tt>RETI</tt> instruction): When interrupts are disabled (which is typically when
        inside an interrupt handler, but it's OK when it happens during normal code where <tt>MASKINT</tt>
        instruction is executed): When ALU operations write the status register, the flags are only
        written to the primary/low side (bits 2, 1, 0). The backup/high side (bits 7, 6, 5) are
        left alone. This has the effect of preserving the status bits upon entering the <tt>IRQ</tt>
        instruction, because any ALU operation when in this state only affects the primary/low
        set of flags.
        </li>
      <li><b>IRQ return</b> - <tt>IRQMASK=0</tt> (interrupts are re-enabled) and <tt>STRES=1</tt>
        (the <tt>RETI</tt> instruction is the only one that sets this control signal): When returning
        from an interrupt handler, <tt>RETI</tt> marks the end of the handler. If <tt>IRQMASK=0</tt>
        and <tt>STRES=1</tt>, the status flags in bits 7, 6, 5 are copied to bits 2, 1, 0 in the
        status register, thus restoring the status flags from before the interrupt handler executed.
        </li>
    </ul>
