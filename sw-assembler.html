    <h2>Software: Assembler</h2>
    <p>
    What I collectively call the "assembler" is actually several components that are all tied together.
    </p>

    <h3>Control Signals</h3>
    <p>
    The <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/control_signals>control_signals</a> file
    is a list of all 32 control signals that can be asserted by a given micro-op (see
    <a href="javascript:show_content('arch-instruction')">Architecture: Instruction Decoding</a> for
    more details.) The <tt>control_signals</tt> file maps human-parseable names (also, names that
    appear in my logic analyzer) to their control ROM and bit position in that ROM, as well as defining
    a default (idle) state for that control signal.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example, take the following signal:
    </p>
    <pre>
    # Instruction &amp; Sequence
    (/NEWOP) 1 0 0x08 # write to opcode register and reset the sequence counter on the next clock
    </pre>
    <p>
    This syntax defines a control signal named <tt>/NEWOP</tt>, whose default state is 1 (high). It
    lives on control ROM 0 at position <tt>0x08</tt> (the fourth bit).
    </p>
    <p>
    Here's another example:
    </p>
    <pre>
    # Program counter write select
    # 0: do nothing
    # 1: increment PC
    # 2: Load PC-low from data bus
    # 3: Load PC-high from data bus
    (PCWSEL) 0 1 0x0c
    </pre>
    <p>
    This defines a control signal named <tt>PCWSEL</tt> that has a default value of 0 (both bits low).
    It lives on control ROM 1 at position <tt>0x0c</tt> (the third and fourth bits).
    </p>
    <p>
    All 32 control signals are mapped out in this way, so that if I make any physical wiring changes
    to the CPU, I only have to update this one file to reflect the change, and rebuild the control ROMs.
    <p>

    <h3>Macros</h3>
    <p>
    The <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/macros>macros</a> file
    takes control signals and combines them into "actions". Here's an example:
    </p>
    <pre>
    {IncrementPC}
    PCWSEL=1

    {WritePCL}
    PCWSEL=2

    {WritePCH}
    PCWSEL=3
    </pre>
    <p>
    This defines three macros, each of which dictate that a given control signal should be set
    to the stated value. I've written it so that for control signals that only have one bit,
    the control signal can simply be stated, and the implied action is that its value will be
    inverted from its default (idle) state.
    </p>
    <pre>
    {WriteStatus}
    /WSTAT
    </pre>
    <p>
    The macros can be thought of like "nano-ops" -- they are the building blocks used to
    construct micro-ops.
    </p>

    <h3>Opcodes</h3>
    <p>
    The <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/gen_opcodes.sh>gen_opcodes.sh</a> script
    generates the opcodes (the complete instruction set) for the Odyssey CPU. Each opcode
    is defined with an opcode ID (<tt>0x00-0xff</tt>), a name (so we can use it in assembly language), and
    any arguments (bytes) that are expected to come after the opcode. Here's a simple one:
    </p>
    <pre>
    [0x0d] DECR_D
    x 0 IncrementPC DecrementD
    x 1 NextInstruction
    </pre>
    <p>
    In the <tt>DECR_D</tt> opcode, the first micro-op activates the <tt>IncrementPC</tt> and <tt>DecrementD</tt>
    macros, which in turn dictate which control signals need to be set. Then the second micro-op activates the
    <tt>NextInstruction</tt> macro, which sets the control signals to load the next opcode from the program counter's 
    address into the opcode register, and to reset the sequence counter.
    </p>
    <p>
    A more complex example with arguments:
    </p>
    <pre>
    [0x0e] ST16 @addr @data
    x 0 IncrementPC IncrementSP
    # PC now points at high byte of address
    # Push D reg onto stack
    x 1 AddrBusSP DataBusDL WriteRAM IncrementSP
    x 2 AddrBusSP DataBusDH WriteRAM
    x 3 AddrBusPC WriteDH IncrementPC
    # PC now points at low byte of address
    x 4 AddrBusPC WriteDL IncrementPC
    # PC now points at high byte of data
    x 5 AddrBusPC WriteTD IncrementPC
    # PC now points at low byte of data
    x 6 AddrBusD DataBusTD WriteRAM
    x 7 AddrBusPC WriteTD IncrementD
    x 8 AddrBusD DataBusTD WriteRAM IncrementPC
    # PC now points at next instruction
    # Pop D reg from stack
    x 9 AddrBusSP WriteDH DecrementSP
    x a AddrBusSP WriteDL DecrementSP
    x b NextInstruction
    </pre>
    <p>
    This one defines the <tt>ST16</tt> opcode, which is expected to have four bytes after it, an address and a
    16 bit data word. In the opcode specification, arguments with <tt>$</tt> prefixes are 8-bit bytes, while those
    with <tt>@</tt> prefixes are 16-bit words. Yeah, I used to write a lot of Perl.
    </p>

    <h3>Control ROM Generation</h3>
    <p>
    With the above three components, it is possible to generate the control ROMs.
    The <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/gen_roms.py>gen_roms.py</a>
    script takes care of this by reading the <tt>control_signals</tt>, <tt>macros</tt>,
    and <tt>opcodes</tt> files, then iterating through all 256 possible opcodes with all of
    the possible ALU flags and sequence numbers, and generates the 32 control signals.
    The results are written out into four 32KiB binary files that are then flashed
    to the control ROMs.
    </p>
    <p>
    This system makes the Odyssey very easy to customize. If I were to change a control
    signal, all I would need to do is update the <tt>control_signals</tt> file (and maybe
    the <tt>macros</tt> file) and re-generate the control ROMs. Similarly (and more commonly),
    if I want to change the behavior of an instruction, or add a new instruction, I just need
    to update <tt>gen_opcodes.sh</tt> and write out (in pretty easy to read syntax) exactly
    what I want the instruction to do. Then run <tt>gen_roms.py</tt> and flash the new ROMs.
    </p>

    <h3>Assembler</h3>
    <p>
    The assembler is still very much a work in progress. It is tied to all the stuff above because
    I have written it to read in the <tt>opcodes</tt> and generate its internal parser based
    on that. This ensures that if I make a change in the instruction set, I only have to
    edit the <tt>gen_opcodes.sh</tt> script, not go fuss around in the assembler to make it
    match how the instructions actually work.
    </p>
    <p>
    The assembler can be found <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/assembler.py>here</a>.
    It is very rudimentary, but I keep making gradual improvements to it. As of February 2024,
    the assembler is basically just a sanity checker (ensures that every instruction in the
    assembly file exists, and that appropriate arguments are provided to each one) and a very
    basic linker (resolves labels into memory addresses). It also can do some basic preprocessing,
    by reading the <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/asm_macros>asm_macros</a>
    file, and replacing matching strings with their numeric counterparts, which helps to make
    the assembly more readable.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 2025 I added more functionality to the assembler, so it can now generate a symbol table,
    read a symbol table, and generate <tt>ODY</tt> executable files. These features were all
    added in support of the ability to have the Odyssey be able to execute programs from disk,
    instead of having everything live in ROM.  More on that topic at 
    <a href="javascript:show_content('sw-ody')">Software: ODY Executables</a>.
    <p>
    The current assembler still has significant limitations today, that I plan to address
    in the future:
    <ul>
      <li>The assembler reads everything as one giant monolithic assembly file. To assemble a
        binary machine code file, I literally just concatenate all the assembly files (including
        all the library files) and assemble it all at once. What would be better (and match what
        proper assemblers do) is to be able to assemble an assembly file and generate an object
        file, which still contains labels, then be able to run a separate <i>linker</i> that
        performs the label resolution. This will become necessary as I begin writing programs
        that live outside the main program ROM. Today I'm basically just writing a BIOS ... all
        of the software is in ROM and thus has a fixed address. But in the future I will need
        to be able to write programs that <i>reference</i> functions in ROM, but not need
        to include them directly. By generating object files and a symbol table, I can read
        the symbol table for the OS/BIOS (which is in ROM), and use it as input to a linker
        that can generate executable (and relocatable) machine code that can run from RAM
        while still calling functions in ROM.</li>
      <li>There is no way today to perform "imports" or "includes". The assembler today will
        barf with errors if you don't assemble 100% of all the possible machine code all
        at once. I'll need ot fix that to start writing "real" programs.</li>
      <li>The assembly language is not very forgiving. Since the opcodes include the register
        names in the instruction name itself, there are a bunch of underscores that make it
        tiring to write assembly for the Odyssey. I would like to update the assembler so that
        instead of writing something like this:
        <pre>
        LDI_AL 0x40
        ALUOP_ADDR_D %A+B%+%AL%+%BH%
        </pre>
        I can instead write something a bit easier to type and read, like:
        <pre>
        ld al 0x40
        add al+bh &amp;D
        </pre>
        and have the assembler translate that into the correct machine code. Today, the assembler
        is <i>extremely</i> literal. The assembly code is really just a thin veneer over the
        raw machine code. By making the assembler have a more general language which is then
        <i>translated</i> into the Odyssey opcodes and arguments, then into machine code, it would
        make reading and writing a lot of stuff easier.</li>
    </ul>
