    <h2>Peripherals: RS232 UART</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    Up until this point, everything I had built for the Wire Wrap Odyssey computer was
    static. All the programming is flashed to an EEPROM and all the software can do
    is interact with the user via the keyboard and display. No data can move into or
    out of the system programmatically. I needed a serial port to enable data transfers
    to and from the system.
    </p>
    <p>
    To implement the UART, my first thought was to use the popular 16550 UART. It is
    highly capable, has on-board 16-bit FIFO buffer, and is basically the gold standard
    of hobbyist UARTs. But it's a physically HUGE chip - a big 40 pin "hershey bar"
    DIP chip. And at the time I was implementing the UART, I was nearly out of board
    space. I could fit the 16550, but there would be no room for the glue logic or the
    RS232 level shifting chip and its supporting passives.
    </p>
    <p>
    So I looked around and eventually settled on the much older <a href="https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/dst/82c52-datasheet">82C52</a>.
    The 82C52 was originally designed to pair with the Intel 8086 CPU, and such
    has some quirks, such as expecting you to have an 82C59 programmable interrupt
    controller and 82C84 clock generator handy. These were a standard part of any
    8086/8088 chipset. But the Wire Wrap Odyssey doesn't have them!
    </p>

    <h3>Interfacing with the 80C52</h3>
    <p>
    Fortunately, most of the quirks could be ignored. The Odyssey has several interrupt
    inputs, while the 8086/8088 only had one. So I didn't need a programmable interrupt
    controller. And the clock generation could be handled by an external crystal. The
    only remaining weirdness is that instead of a single <tt>/WRITE</tt> pin (which
    implies "read" when high), there are <i>separate</i> <tt>/READ</tt> and <tt>/WRITE</tt>
    pins. This meant some somewhat clever glue logic was needed to translate my single
    <tt>/WRAM</tt> signal coming from the CPU, into the right signals at the right times.
    Here's what I came up with:

    <p>
    An 8-input OR/NOR gate (<tt>74x4078</tt>) decodes the top 8 bits of the address,
    generating a signal when the address in the <tt>0xc100-0xc1ff</tt> range. This is
    ANDed with the inverted clock signal and then further NANDed with normal and
    inverted versions of <tt>/WRAM</tt> to generate the <tt>/RD</tt> and <tt>/WR</tt>
    signals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Other than the weird <tt>/RD</tt>and <tt>/WR</tt> signals, everything else is
    pretty standard: two address pins, eight data pins, and a bunch of pins for
    the serial interface, which are wired up to a <tt>MAX202</tt> RS232 level shifter.
    </p>

    I made the mistake when first implementing the UART, thinking that the serial
    pins on the 80C52 could be wired directly to the 9-pin serial port. But the
    signals coming out of the 80C52 are NOT RS232, the're just TTL levels, and
    actually inverted from the RS232 signals. The <tt>MAX202</tt> takes the TTL
    signals (<tt>0v = 0/space, 5v = 1/mark</tt>) and converts them to RS232 signals
    (<tt>+3 to +15v = space, -15 to -3v = mark</tt>). If you're integrating
    a UART into your project and expect to use a standard 9 or 25 pin computer serial port
    to communicate with it, you need to have an RS232 level shifter.

    <h3>Software support</h3>
    <p>
    Interfacing with the UART is much the same as with any other memory-mapped
    peripheral. Just read and write memory addresses that are mapped to the device.
    The 80C52 can be a bit finnicky though, and it took me quite some time to
    get all the sequencing right. So naturally I abstracted the functionality
    into a <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/lib/uart.asm>library</a>.
    The library contains some helpful functions to make interfacing with the
    UART easier:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>:uart_init_&lt;baud&gt;</tt> - resets and initializes the UART to a particular speed</li>
      <li><tt>:uart_sendchar</tt> - writes the character in <tt class=register>AL</tt> to the UART and blocks until it has finished sending the character</li>
      <li><tt>:uart_irq_dr_buf</tt> - used as an interrupt handler for IRQ5, when a byte is received by
                the UART, this handler retrieves the byte and shifts it into a buffer for later retrieval.
                This ensures that the UART is able to immediately receive the next byte. The 80C52 only
                has one byte of buffer - if the CPU doesn't read the byte immediately, it can be overwritten
                by the next incoming byte.</li>
      <li><tt>:uart_bufsize</tt>, <tt>:uart_readbuf</tt> - reads from the buffer</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <div class=tip-container>
    The 82C52 is a stickler for the modem control signals. When it is sending a character, it will wait
    patiently (forever) waiting for the <tt>/CTS</tt> (clear to send) signal to be asserted from the
    remote terminal. If you are building your own RS232 interface, make sure the terminal program
    you are using (and the USB-to-serial adapter you are using) is following the strict RTS/CTS signaling
    protocol. I am able to get things working by using GTKTerm and configuring the serial device for
    the appropriate baud rate, word length, parity bits, and stop bits, and no flow control. To remind
    myself of how to configure the remote terminal, <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/20-cmd_console.asm>
    I put some notes at the top of the source code for the VT220 console program</a>.

    <p>
    I have been able to write a serial interface "terminal" program that makes
    the Odyssey behave (sort of) like a VT220 virtual terminal. I am able to
    connect to my Linux laptop over an RS232 cable, log in, and use the more
    modern computer over the serial connection
