    <h2>Video Card: Color Generation</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    If you're been reading through the video card architecture pages, you should already be familiar with
    <a href="javascript:show_content('video-hsync-vsync')">Hsync &amp Vsync Generation</a> and
    <a href="javascript:show_content('video-char')">Character Generation</a>. Let's now discuss how to add
    color to the display.
    </p>

    <h3>How VGA generates pixels</h3>
    <p>
    The VGA plug has three pins, one each for red, green, and blue. On CRTs, these were wired directly
    (via some amplifier circuitry) to the electron guns for each of the three colors. The VGA spec
    dictates that for black, the pin should be at 0 volts, and for full brightness for that color,
    the pin should be at 0.7 volts. So to generate a white pixel, you'd bring all three red, green,
    and blue pins to 0.7 volts. to generate a yellow pixel, you'd bring red and green to 0.7 volts,
    and blue to 0 volts. It's analog, so any voltage betwen 0 and 0.7 volts is OK.
    </p>

    <h3>Color in the Odyssey video card</h3>
    <p>
    I followed the same approach for color as I did for character generation. I designated another
    4KiB block of the frame buffer memory to color data. So for any given byte in the character frame buffer,
    I can find a color byte by just adding <tt>0x1000</tt> to the character address. From the CPU's perspective,
    <tt>0x4000</tt> is the first character on the display. <tt>0x5000</tt> is thus the color byte
    for that character. This approach allows me to use all the same counters and addressing schemes
    to find color data, only with the 13th bit set to 1 instead of 0.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each byte in the color range contains these bits:
    </p>
    <table class="bit-table">
    <tr>
      <th>7</td>
      <th>6</td>
      <th>5</td>
      <th>4</td>
      <th>3</td>
      <th>2</td>
      <th>1</td>
      <th>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan=1>blink</td>
      <td colspan=1>crsr</td>
      <td colspan=2>R</td>
      <td colspan=2>G</td>
      <td colspan=2>B</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    This arrangement allows each character to be displayed in one of 64 different colors.
    </p>

    <div class="tip-container">
    <p>
    This is a place where I made a bad architectural decision. On the old 80s and 90s video
    cards, six bits of color data were (likely) arranged like so:
    </p>
    <table class="bit-table">
    <tr>
      <th>7</td>
      <th>6</td>
      <th>5</td>
      <th>4</td>
      <th>3</td>
      <th>2</td>
      <th>1</td>
      <th>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan=1>crsr</td>
      <td colspan=1>back-R</td>
      <td colspan=1>back-G</td>
      <td colspan=1>back-B</td>
      <td colspan=1>bright</td>
      <td colspan=1>fore-R</td>
      <td colspan=1>fore-G</td>
      <td colspan=1>fore-B</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    This arrangement (or something like it) provides for 16 colors. If bit #3 is 0, the red, green and blue
    signals are all emitted at half brightness. If bit #3 is 1, they're all emitted at full brightness. That
    means you get 8 principal colors (black, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, orange, white) that can then
    be brightened to make 8 more colors. This arrangement leaves three bits for defining the background color,
    (which can only be the half-brightness variety) and still leaves a spare bit for specifying a cursor
    (or maybe a blink bit).
    </p>
    <p>
    The color layout I chose for the Odyssey gave up being able to set a background color in favor of having
    64 discrete colors. But in practice, it turns out that 8/16 colors is plenty, and I really do miss having
    background colors.

    <h3>Generating color signals</h3>
    <p>
    Review the block diagram below (click to embiggen) in the bottom two boxes, "Blink, Cursor, and Viewable Area
    Logic", and "Color Generation". When each new character is loaded from the framebuffer, a color byte is also
    loaded (there is some clever timing involved to perform both of those reads at the right time). The color
    byte register's outputs are fed through some combinatorial logic so that if the current pixel is "on",
    the correct R, G, B bits are fed to the color outputs. If the current pixel is "off", a black signal
    (all zeroes) are fed to the color outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is also some logic that takes the <tt>SLOW_CLK</tt> (which is just a square wave cycling at around
    2-4Hz) and if the <tt>BLINK</tt> bit is set for the character, gates the color outputs as well. The same
    <tt>SLOW_CLK</tt> is used with the <tt>CURSOR</tt> bit, so that if the character has the cursor enabled,
    and <tt>SLOW_CLK</tt> is low, and it's the seventh or eighth line of the bitmap, that the color outputs
    are all set to maximum value (so a white pixel is drawn).
    </p>
    <p>
    To generate the 0-0.7 volt signal, a resistor voltage divider is used to take the 0-5 volt digital signal
    coming from the output of the combinatorial logic, into the appropriate signal. Note that the VGA cabling spec
    dictates that the R, G, and B lines all have a 75 ohm pull-down resistor, so you have to account for
    that when designing your voltage divider. I ended up just copying Ben Eater's design from
    his <a href='https://eater.net/vga'>Let's build a video card</a> video series. In the second video he
    describes how to generate the RGB signals using a resistor network, using 1.5k and 680 ohm resistors.
