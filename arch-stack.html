    <h2>Architecture: Stack Pointer</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    A <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register>stack register</a> is a crucial
    piece of hardware required so that a CPU can execute subroutine calls. When a program
    requests to enter a subroutine, the CPU must have a way to store the return address,
    and must do so in such a way that nested calls (e.g. subsequent subroutine calls while
    already inside a subroutine) can be handled properly.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Odyssey CPU implements a very simple stack architecture, with a single 8-bit <tt class=register>SP</tt>
    register that is implemented with a pair of <tt>74x191</tt> 4-bit up/down counters.
    Control of these counters is achieved with two control signals, resulting in four
    possible states:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>SPSEL 00</tt> - do nothing</li>
      <li><tt>SPSEL 01</tt> - do nothing</li>
      <li><tt>SPSEL 10</tt> - increment <tt class=register>SP</tt></li>
      <li><tt>SPSEL 11</tt> - decrement <tt class=register>SP</tt></li>
    </ul>
    There is also a <tt>/SPADDR</tt> control signal that when pulled low, presents the
    <tt class=register>SP</tt> register to the low 8 bits of the address bus, and
    a constant <tt>0xbf</tt> to the high 8 bits of the address bus.

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
    The Odyssey instruction set includes a number of opcodes that can <tt>PUSH</tt> or
    <tt>POP</tt>, which directly manipulates the stack. There are also <tt>CALL</tt>
    and <tt>RET</tt>, and <tt>IRQ</tt> and <tt>RETI</tt> opcodes, which use the stack
    for its primary purpose of call tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
    In typical usage, a program will issue a <tt>CALL</tt> to jump into a subroutine.
    The subroutine will then <tt>PUSH</tt> registers onto the stack that it will be
    using to perform its work. Before returning from the subroutine, it will <tt>POP</tt>
    those registers back into place, and then issue <tt>RET</tt> to return to
    the calling code.
    </p>

    <h3>Function Arguments</h3>
    <p>
    In some (most?) CPU architectures, the stack can be used to store arguments to a function.
    This is not possible with the Odyssey CPU (at least not easily) as there is only the
    single <tt class=register>SP</tt> register. If a caller pushes some arguments onto the
    stack and then issues <tt>CALL</tt>, the called subroutine will find that the return
    address is at the top of the stack, not the arguments to the function.
    </p>
    <p>
    One way this is worked around in the Odyssey is to have many simple functions just use
    registers directly for arguments. Typically a single-argument function will expect to
    find the argument stored in the <tt class=register>AL</tt> register, with the returned
    value often coming back in <tt class=register>AL</tt> as well.  This mechanism works
    pretty well for functions that have a fixed and small argument list.
    </p>
    <p>
    The other way this is worked around is by implementing a second stack <i>in software</i>,
    which is called the "heap". Advanced functions that require a long or variable length
    argument list can be coded to expect their arguments to be present on the heap, rather
    than the stack. The caller uses functions from
    <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/lib/heap.asm>heap.asm</a> 
    to push arguments onto the heap, then issues a <tt>CALL</tt> to jump into the subroutine.
    The subroutine uses heap functions to pop the arguments from the heap. Heap operations
    do not impact the stack, and the FIFO nature of the heap also preserves the call stack
    semantics. However, because all heap operations require callouts to subroutines, each
    of which have a dozen or so instructions, heap operations are a lot slower than stack
    operations.
