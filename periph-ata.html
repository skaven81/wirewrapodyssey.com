    <h2>Peripherals: ATA Port</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The final (for now, at least) peripheral I plan to add to the Odyssey computer is
    an ATA (AT Attachment) port, often called an IDE (integrated drive electronics)
    port. You know, the 40-pin port that you'd hook a hard drive to in 286, 386, 486,
    Slot 1/A, and Socket 7 systems.
    </p>
    <p>
    It sounds impossibly complex at first -- normally the ATA/IDE port on a PC motherboard
    was handled by a VLSI southbridge chip. But the ATA protocol is actually very simple,
    if used in its earliest and simplest PIO (programmed I/O) mode, instead of the faster
    (but much more complex) DMA (direct memory access) mode.
    </p>
    <p>
    I found <a href=https://blog.retroleum.co.uk/electronics-articles/an-8-bit-ide-interface/>
    this excellent blog post</a> detailing how the ATA/IDE connector is wired, and how data
    is moved across it. It's actually quite simple, and behaves like most memory-mapped
    peripherals do. There's three address pins (and thus eight control registers) and
    sixteen data pins, and the usual chip select, read, and write pins. Communicating with
    an IDE device over the ATA bus simply requires writing the appropriate values to
    control registers (which reside in the IDE drive), then sending a command (which is
    just writing to one of the control registers).
    </p>
    <p>
    There are two key challenges for making this work with the Odyssey CPU. The first is
    that the Odyssey only has an 8-bit data bus, while the ATA bus is sixteen bits wide.
    This can be addressed by having an 8-bit register that is written before writing
    the actual command. The register can then provide the upper 8 bits of the data. The
    same process can be used when reading: each read puts the high 8 bits into the register,
    and the low 8 bits onto the data bus. The CPU can then read from the register to
    grab the high 8 bits. The second challenge is timing. In the blog post, the author
    was interfacing an IDE device to a Z80 CPU, which resulted in some Z80-specific
    glue logic. My implementation required Odyssey-specific control logic to ensure the
    timing requirements were met.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
    The implementation I went with ended up straying pretty far from the blog post linked above.
    Basically the only common thing was the use of 8-bit registers to store the high byte
    of the 16-bit ATA bus when reading and writing.

    <p>
    There's a lot going on in that schematic. The general idea is that the <tt>0xc300-0xc3ff</tt>
    address range is "owned" by the ATA port circuitry.  The big NOR gate at the top left
    generates <tt>ADDR_C3</tt> and <tt>/ADDR_C3</tt> signals which are used to gate other aspects
    of the circuit.  In the second row, you can see the array of AND and NAND gates used to generate
    the glue logic for the ATA control signals.  <tt>/CS0gen</tt> is low when address is between
    <tt>0xc300-0xc307</tt> and <tt>/CS1gen</tt> is low when address is between <tt>0xc308-0xc30f</tt>.  
    The <tt>/HIWR</tt> and <tt>/HIRD</tt> (write/read from high byte register) signals are asserted
    for any address between <tt>0xc310-0xc31f</tt> and depending on whether the <tt>/WRAM</tt> signal
    is asserted. The ATA <tt>/WRgen</tt> and <tt>/RDgen</tt> signals (for reading/writing to the
    ATA port) are similar, but are gated by <tt>SEQ45</tt>, which I'll discuss in a bit.
    </p>

    <p>
    The rest of the circuitry is all about getting the timing right.  And this was the hardest
    part of getting the ATA port to work.  I found that a common constraint for chips of this
    era is that the read or write signals will latch the address on their falling edge, then
    write (or read) the data on their rising edge.  Further, many require that the chip select signal
    not be released for some period of time after the write signal is released.
    </p>

    <p>
    So I came up with a set of "slow" Odyssey instructions that spread read and write signals
    over multiple clocks, to allow for logic in the peripheral to assert and release internal
    signals over those multiple clocks.  All of these "slow" instructions guarantee timing
    for reads and writes.
    </p>

    <p>
    For writes:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>SEQ4</tt> - peripheral should latch the address and data</li>
      <li><tt>SEQ5</tt> - <tt>/WRAM</tt> will be asserted</li>
      <li><tt>SEQ6</tt> - address and data remain asserted</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    For reads:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>SEQ3</tt> - address is valid</li>
      <li><tt>SEQ4</tt> - address is valid</li>
      <li><tt>SEQ5</tt> - address is valid - CPU will commit value on data bus at end of clock</li>
      <li><tt>SEQ6</tt> - address is valid</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    The peripheral thus needs to know which sequence number it is in, to know when to perform
    internal latches.  This is accomplished (for the ATA port at least) with the <tt>SEQ45</tt>
    signal, which is asserted when the sequence register is value 4 or 5.  I specifically chose for
    the "commit data" step in the "slow" instructions to be at sequence number 5, because the
    transition between 4 (<tt>0b100</tt>) and 5 (<tt>0b101</tt>) is glitchless.  That means
    a signal can be created (<tt>SEQ45</tt>) that is asserted upon entering sequence number 4
    and then stays asserted (without glitching) through sequence number 5, before being cleared.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <tt>SEQ45</tt> signal is what allows (through all the glue logic shown above) the timing
    to work.  The timing is shown in this rather complex hand-drawn timing diagram:
    </p>

      <figcaption class='figure-caption'>
        ATA port signal timing. Click for fullsize.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
    The timing diagram can be read as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>SEQ</tt> - the microcode sequence number</li>
      <li><tt>CLK</tt> - the clock signal</li>
      <li><tt>ADDR</tt> - the address bus. <tt>X</tt> represents periods where the address bus might
                          not be stable, and <tt>R</tt> and <tt>W</tt> indicate when the address bus
                          is stable for reads and writes, accordingly.</li>
      <li><tt>ATA ADDR</tt> - the ATA port's address bus, same <tt>X</tt>, <tt>R</tt>, and <tt>W</tt>
                          meaning as the CPU address bus.</li>
      <li><tt>/WRAM</tt> - when the <tt>/WRAM</tt> signal is low (for writes; it stays high for reads)</li>
      <li><tt>ADDR_C3_buf</tt> - the buffered <tt>ADDR_C3</tt> signal</li>
      <li><tt>/CS0</tt>, <tt>/RD</tt>, <tt>/WR</tt> - the ATA port signals</li>
      <li><tt>DATA</tt> - the CPU data bus on read and write operations. <tt>0</tt> indicates valid data on the bus.</li>
      <li><tt>ATA HI</tt> - the ATA bus high byte status. <tt>0</tt> indicates valid data on the bus.</li>
    </ul>
    The dotted lines running vertically mark the critical timing for reads (left) and writes (right).
    What the resulting timing ensures is that the <tt>/CS0</tt> (or <tt>/CS1</tt>) signal is asserted
    first, then a clock later, the <tt>/RD</tt> or </tt>/WR</tt> signal is asserted. After being released,
    a clock cycle passes before <tt>/CS0</tt> or <tt>/CS1</tt> are released.  This conforms (enough) to
    the "programmed I/O" (PIO) mode of ATA bus operation.
