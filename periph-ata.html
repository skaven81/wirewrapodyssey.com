    <h2>Peripherals: ATA Port</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The final (for now, at least) peripheral I plan to add to the Odyssey computer is
    an ATA (AT Attachment) port, sometimes called an IDE (integrated drive electronics)
    port. You know, the 40-pin port that you'd hook a hard drive to in 286, 386, 486,
    Slot 1/A, and Socket 7 systems.
    </p>
    <p>
    It sounds impossibly complex at first -- normally the ATA/IDE port on a PC motherboard
    was handled by a VLSI southbridge chip. But the ATA protocol is actually very simple,
    if used in its earliest and simplest PIO (programmed I/O) mode, instead of the faster
    (but much more complex) DMA (direct memory access) mode.
    </p>
    <p>
    I found <a href=https://blog.retroleum.co.uk/electronics-articles/an-8-bit-ide-interface/>
    this excellent blog post</a> detailing how the ATA/IDE connector is wired, and how data
    is moved across it. It's actually quite simple, and behaves like most memory-mapped
    peripherals do. There's three address pins (and thus eight control registers) and
    sixteen data pins, and the usual chip select, read, and write pins. Communicating with
    an IDE device over the ATA bus simply requires writing the appropriate values to
    control registers (which reside in the IDE drive), then sending a command (which is
    just writing to one of the control registers).
    </p>
    <p>
    There are two key challenges for making this work with the Odyssey CPU. The first is
    that the Odyssey only has an 8-bit data bus, while the ATA bus is sixteen bits wide.
    This can be addressed by having an 8-bit register that is written before writing
    the actual command. The register can then provide the upper 8 bits of the data. The
    same process can be used when reading: each read puts the high 8 bits into the register,
    and the low 8 bits onto the data bus. The CPU can then read from the register to
    grab the high 8 bits. The second challenge is timing. In the blog post, the author
    was interfacing an IDE device to a Z80 CPU, which resulted in some Z80-specific
    glue logic. I'll have to come up with Odyssey-specific logic to ensure that the
    timing requirements are met. I may also need to add some custom opcodes that hold
    the data and address lines for extra clock cycles to ensure all the timing works right.

    <h3>Implementation: in progress!</h3>
    <p>
    I haven't started actually desiging or building the ATA port yet. When I do, the plan
    is to use an SD-to-IDE adapter as the primary disk drive for the Odyssey. But since
    all IDE drives (at least, those that support PIO-0 mode) should work, in theory I could
    hook up an old IDE hard drive, or even a CD-ROM to the port and have it work. That
    would be a fun experiment! And the ATA port allows for two drives on the same bus,
    so I actually could have both removable media (an SD card or CD-ROM) and fixed media
    (an IDE hard drive) both working simultaneously!
