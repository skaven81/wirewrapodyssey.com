    <p>
    The Wire Wrap Odyssey is a custom 8-bit microcoded CPU with a 16-bit address bus.
    It is built primarily from 7400-series logic (mostly <tt>HC</tt> series). There are
    no VLSI components in the core system at all, nearly everything is built around
    simple logic components such as <tt>74x377</tt> D flip flops, <tt>74x245</tt> bus
    transceivers, multiplexers, selectors, and a generous pile of simple logic gates.
    </p>

    <h2>But why?</h2>

    <p>
    As part of my computer science curriculum at Texas A&amp;M University from 2000-2005,
    I took a computer architecture course where I learned how computers work at the
    fundamental level.  The textbook for the course, <i>Computer Organization and
    Design: The Hardware/Software Interface</i> by David Patterson and John Hennessy,
    walked us through designing a 32-bit MIPS CPU, culminating in an actual working 
    (virtual) CPU designed in Verilog.
    </p>

    <p>
    Something about this course during my studies stuck with me, as I started to better
    understand how the early microcomputers such as the Apple I and Apple ][, Commodore
    64, TRS-80, and even early x86 systems like the PC-XT with Intel's 8088 and 80286,
    were designed.  These early computers were sufficiently simple that the entire
    architecture could be understood by a single person.
    </p>

    <p>
    I also discovered the Homebuilt Computers Webring, which introduced me to dozens
    of ambitious projects being undertaken by mere mortals like myself, to build
    homemade computers.  For example, the
    <a href="http://www.homebrewcpu.com/" target=_blank>Magic-1</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/bmow1/" target=_blank>BMOW-1</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    So in 2010, I began working on my own homebuilt computer.  The Wire Wrap Odyssey
    is the result.  Over a decade in the making (but realistically starting in earnest
    in 2019 after finally settling on wire wrap as the best way to construct the system),
    the Wire Wrap Odyssey has been a long LONG journey of dead ends, failed designs,
    questionable implementations, and tricky troubleshooting.

    <h2>What you will find here</h2>

    <p>
    This website documents all of what went into making the Wire Wrap Odyssey work,
    including the parts I did wrong, the parts I think I did right, and all the
    documentation I've collected along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
    All of my schematics and design notes are on paper, so I've scanned in these pages
    for you to peruse (see the <a href="javascript:show_content('documentation')">Documentation</a> section).
    However, I do not recommend that you attempt to replicate my work.  There are far
    better designs out there if you are interested in tackling a project like this.

    <b><a href="javascript:accordion_and_show_content('video-accordion', 'video-overview')">Video Card</a></b> - the video card peripheral is sufficiently complex that it warrants
    its own section.  It's also inextricably linked to the CPU itself, unlike other
