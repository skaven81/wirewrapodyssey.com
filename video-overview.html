    <h2>Video Card Overview</h2>
    <p>
    The video card was the first major component implemented in the Wire Wrap Odyssey CPU.
    It served as a testbed to see if wire wrap was a feasible way of implementing the rest
    of the Odyssey CPU, and is sufficiently isolated from the rest of the CPU that it could
    be completely built and tested without having to build the rest of the CPU.
    </p>
    <p>
    The video card design is heavily influenced by <a href="https://eater.net/vga" target=_blank>Ben Eater's VGA project</a>.
    Like Ben Eater's project, the video card implements timing signals for a 640x480 pixel
    display at 60Hz refresh rate.  However, unlike Ben Eater's project, I opted to use the
    full speed 25.175MHz pixel clock, rather than Ben Eater's 10MHz pixel clock. The use
    of a full speed pixel clock meant I could utilize all of the pixels in the display.
    However, directly addressing 640x480 (307,200) pixels would require far more RAM than
    I had available. So instead I opted for a "character display" where the 640x480
    pixels are broken into a grid of 8x8 pixel glyphs. I further reduced this to only
    64 glyphs wide (512 pixels) so that the resulting memory array for storing the
    characters would fit precisely in a 4KiB range (<tt>0xn000-0xnfff</tt>). 480 lines is only
    enough for 60 characters though, so in reality the range is <tt>0xn000-0xnefff</tt>.
    Color is implemented by storing color data that is applied to each 8x8 glyph, in
    a symmetric memory range.

    Like everything else in the Wire Wrap Odyssey project, the video card was built up
    bit by bit, giving me an opportunity to test each unit independently before moving
    on to the next one.  See the detailed sections for more information on how each
    sub-unit of the video card was implemented.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('video-hsync-vsync')">Hsync &amp Vsync Generation</a>
        - basic timing requirements that allow a VGA monitor to sync. Once this sub-unit was
        completed, I was able to connect a VGA monitor and see that it detects a 640x480 60Hz
        signal.</li>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('video-char')">Character Generation</a>
        - this is the logic that generates the on/off signal for the CRT beam. As the pixel
        clock ticks, characters are read from RAM, and their glyph is read from a font ROM.
        This bitmap is then fed into a shift register that outputs the pixels that should
        be on or off as the beam scans across each 8-pixel block of the display.</li>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('video-color')">Color Generation</a>
        - a similar process is used to read the color data from RAM for each 8x8 block, which
        is then fed into a register that outputs into a DAC to generate the red, blue,
        and green values for the VGA signal. The color data is six bit (64 colors) and
        can implement blinking and/or a cursor at the character position.</li>
    </ul>
