    <h2>Software: ALU Generation</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    As discussed at <a href="javascript:show_content('arch-alu')">Architecture: ALU</a>, the ALU for
    the Odyssey computer is implemented as a lookup table (LUT) in a pair of <tt>AT28C256</tt> 32KiB
    EEPROMs. Each EEPROM implements a 4-bit slice of the ALU. The 15 address bits of the EEPROM are
    mapped as follows:
    </p>
    <table class="bit-table">
      <tr>
        <th>14</td>
        <th>13</td>
        <th>12</td>
        <th>11</td>
        <th>10</td>
        <th>9</td>
        <th>8</td>
        <th>7</td>
        <th>6</td>
        <th>5</td>
        <th>4</td>
        <th>3</td>
        <th>2</td>
        <th>1</td>
        <th>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan=5><tt>ALUOP</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Cin-MSB</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Cin-LSB</tt></td>
        <td colspan=4><tt>A</tt></td>
        <td colspan=4><tt>B</tt></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    And the 8-bit output value is mapped as:
    </p>
    <table class="bit-table">
      <tr>
        <th>7</td>
        <th>6</td>
        <th>5</td>
        <th>4</td>
        <th>3</td>
        <th>2</td>
        <th>1</td>
        <th>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Z</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>E</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Cout-MSB</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Cout-LSB</tt></td>
        <td colspan=4><tt>OUT</tt></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    To generate the LUT, is a (relatively) simple matter of enumerating all 32,768 input states,
    computing the output state, and storing all of these in a binary file that is flashed to
    the EEPROM.
    </p>

    <h3>Code</h3>
    <p>
    The source code for the ALU generator is <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/tree/master/alu>here</a>.
    The primary source is <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/alu/four_bit_alu.py>four_bit_alu.py</a>,
    which defines a class named <tt>FourBitALU</tt>. Each instance of the class
    fixes all of the input values except for the opcode, as well as a flag
    indicating whether it's the "high" ALU or not. Then there is a single
    method, <tt>compute(op)</tt>, which computes the expected value for the
    given opcode.
    </p>
    <p>
    It's probably not the best model -- I probably should have moved the other inputs into the arguments for
    the <tt>compute()</tt> method and just left the <tt>self.high</tt> attribute as the only one defined at
    construction. But it works.
    </p>
    <p>
    Importantly, throughout the <tt>compute()</tt> method, I have tons of assertions to make sure that the
    output is being computed correctly, and that I'm not truncating extra bits or anything like that.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is then <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/alu/eight_bit_alu.py>eight_bit_alu.py</a>,
    which is a software simulator of the full ALU with both EEPROMs. It stitches two instances of the <tt>FourBitALU</tt>
    class together the same way the physical LUTs are wired in the Odyssey, and then provides its own
    <tt>compute()</tt> method that generates the full eight bit values.
    </p>
    <p>
    With this code in place, I wrote some simple test scripts:
    <ul>
      <li><a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/alu/alu_sim.py>alu_sim.py</a> - iterates through
        all possible input values for the combined 8-bit ALU, checking for any assertion errors.</li>
      <li><a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/alu/alu_repl.py>alu_repl.py</a> - a utility for
        running a REPL (read, execute, print, loop) on a simulated 8-bit ALU. This allows me to run quick verifications
        against what I see in the physical computer, and compare it with the simulation, to make sure that they match.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/alu/gen_alu_roms.py>gen_alu_roms.py</a> performs
    the bitwise iteration to generate the binary ROM images to flash into the EEPROMs.
