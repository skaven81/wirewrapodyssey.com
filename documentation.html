    <h2>Notebook Scans</h2>

    <p>
    These are direct scans of my design and build notes. This is not meant to be a guide
    for how to build your own Wire Wrap Odyssey computer. Mostly I'm keeping this around
    for posterity.
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-Odyssey CPU design notes <a href="pdf/old_cpu.pdf" target=_blank>PDF</a> (last updated 2023-12-31)</li>

    <h2>Source Code</h2>

    <p>
    The git repository with all the source code (and some additional notes) can be found at
    <a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu" target=_blank>https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu</a>
    </p>

    Some notable items in the git repository:
    <ul>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/control_signals" target=_blank>control_signals</a></tt>
        - the lowest level of abstraction, mapping the control signals to output bits on a control ROM</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/macros" target=_blank>macros</a></tt>
        - the next level of abstraction, mapping control signal values (in hex/binary) to human-readable tokens describing
        the behavior of each control signal setting.</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/gen_opcodes.sh" target=_blank>gen_opcodes.sh</a></tt>
        - script that generates the <tt>opcodes</tt> list. Each opcode's microcode is encoded in the output of this script.</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/gen_roms.py" target=_blank>gen_roms.py</a></tt>
        - script that takes the <tt>control_signals</tt>, <tt>macros</tt>, and <tt>opcodes</tt> as input, and generates the
        control ROM binary images.</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/assembler.py" target=_blank>assembler.py</a></tt>
        - custom assembler. Reads <tt>.asm</tt> files, performs various utility functions such as macro expansion, variable
        memory assignment, and label rewriting. Sanity checks assembly programs and generates binaries that can be flashed
        to the program ROM. The assembler reads <tt>opcodes</tt> and generates its parser dynamically.</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/opcode_cheatsheet" target=_blank>opcode_cheatsheet</a></tt>
        - file I keep open when writing Odyssey assembly programs to help me remember the names of all the opcodes and
        the various memory ranges and such.</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/asm_macros" target=_blank>asm_macros</a></tt>
        - not to be confused with <tt>macros</tt>, this file is only read by the assembler, and defines a list of macros that
        the assembler will replace with static values. Essentially the same as <tt>#define</tt> statements in C, but hackier.</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/tree/master/assembler/lib" target=_blank>/assembler/lib/</a></tt>
        - utility libraries that form the foundation of the OdysseyOS.</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/tree/master/assembler/os_shell" target=_blank>/assembler/os_shell/</a></tt>
        - the OdysseyOS top level assembly. This is where the code at <tt>0x0000</tt> in the program ROM comes from, and how
        the Odyssey CPU bootstraps itself to a shell.</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/tree/master/alu" target=_blank>/alu/</a></tt>
        - the Odyssey ALU generation code. The ALU in the Odyssey is implemented as a LUT (look up table) in two ROMs. This 
        directory contains the code for generating the ROMs and for testing the ALU behavior.</li>
      <li><tt><a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/tree/master/logisim" target=_blank>/logisim/</a></tt>
        - some of the more gnarly glue logic I first designed and tested in Logisim before implementing. The files in this
        directory are not necessarily exactly what was implemented.
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://buildacpu.blogspot.com/" target=_blank>Buildacpu</a> - my first attempt at documenting my
        homebrew CPU project. Covers 2010-2016. I made the move to wire wrap and the current Odyssey design, in 2019.
        The current Odyssey design was heavily influenced by the prior failed attempts from the decade before.</li>
      <li><a href="https://eater.net/" target=_blank>Ben Eater</a> - this guy is an amazing teacher and it was his
        <a href="https://eater.net/vga" target=_blank>Let's build a video card!</a> video series that finally closed
        the gap for me on how I would design the Odyssey CPU in such a way that it could work as a "real" computer
        with a monitor, instead of just having an LCD or LED display. I heartily recommend all of Ben Eater's videos
        and project kits.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/bmow1/" target=_blank>BMOW-1 Computer</a> - the wildly popular
        "Big Mess O'Wires" computer designed and built in 2008 or so by Steve Chamberlin was an early source of inspiration
        for me to build my Odyssey computer. The BMOW-1 is a truly capable computer, with color graphics, a fully fleshed
        out operating system, and loads of working peripherals. For some reason I completely ignored Steve's choice to use wire wrap
        for his implementation, and this cost me several years of false starts trying to use breadboards and point-to-point
        soldering. But I eventually came around and saw the light of wire wrap!</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.homebrewcpu.com/" target=_blank>MAGIC-1 Computer</a> - another impressively implemented
        homebrew CPU project. This one runs MINIX and is even connected to the internet.</li>
