    <h2>Architecture: Address and Data Bus</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    There is not much to say about the buses. The address bus is 16 bits wide,
    and the data bus is 8 bits wide.
    </p>

    <h3>Pullups</h3>
    <p>
    Both buses are pulled high with 330 ohm pullup
    resistors. Yeah, that's pretty low for a pullup resistor (and causes any chip
    sinking a bus line to sink 15mA per pin!) but it turned out to be necessary
    to get the signal propagation time down low enough to run at 2MHz and above.
    </p>

    <p>
    The signal propagation problem is because address decoding is the first step
    in many of the CPU units. For example, the RAM, ROM, and peripherals must not
    put any data on the data bus, if the address lines are all high. So the time
    it takes from a rising clock edge (and thus a new micro-op), then there is
    propagation through the control ROMs, which then trigger propagation through
    things like bus transceivers to enable or disable output to the address bus.
    Assuming nothing is supposed to be presenting data to the address bus, all that
    propagation delay has to happen first, and then it takes some time for the
    pullup resistors to draw all of the address lines high.
    </p>
    <p>
    For most of the design process, 1K pullups worked fine, but once I added the
    auxiliary prototyping board with the extended RAM on it, I found that the
    system would not run stably at reasonable clock speeds anymore. Using my
    oscilloscope I found that the address lines were sometimes taking too long
    to come back to a high state, which meant that the extended RAM (or ROM,
    or RAM) were taking too long to quiesce the data bus, causing data corruption.
    Going to a 330 ohm pullup solved the problem for now, but long term I plan
    to swap out <tt>HC</tt> series components that are in the critical timing path, with
    <tt>A</tt> series components that have lower propagation delays, which should
    solve the problem in a more appropriate way.
    </p>

    <h3>Bus Interface</h3>
    <p>
    The three boards of the computer are connected by a 40-pin cable (just a standard
    IDE cable) that carries the address and data bus signals, along with the <tt>/WRAM</tt>,
    <tt>CLK</tt>, and <tt>RST</tt> signals. The pinout is loosely based on the ATA spec.
