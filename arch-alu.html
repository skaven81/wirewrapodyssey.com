    <h2>Architecture: Arithmetic Logic Unit</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    When I first started working on a homebrew CPU design, I naturally gravitated toward
    the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/74181><tt>74181</tt></a> ALU, as it was already
    there, could be combined to build an arbitrary-size ALU, and even had support chips like
    the <tt>74381</tt> and <tt>74382</tt> that can generate the generate, propagate, and carry
    signals for high performance operation. There are plenty of computers out there that used
    the <tt>74181</tt>, including the legendary <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto#Architecture>
    Xerox Alto</a>. If it was good enough for Xerox PARC, it should be good enough for me!
    </p>

    <p>
    But upon further inspection, I started to second guess this idea. Looking closely at
    the datasheet, have a look at the function table:
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
    Only a handful of these functions are actually useful. Most of them are just side effects
    of the internal logic. Plus there's no right shift operation (just a left shift). I'm sure
    that the wizards at Xerox had no trouble pressing most of these operations into useful
    service in the Alto OS, but I wanted something a bit more approachable. I also wanted to
    have a few custom ALU operations that would make manipulating colors in the video card
    easier.
    </p>

    <h3>EEPROM-based sliced ALU</h3>
    <p>
    With that in mind, I decided to build my own ALU. Yep. I built one myself. Though I will
    admit that the approach I took was a bit like cheating, as it's really just an extension
    of the same approach I used for instruction decoding. I used a pair of <tt>AT28C256</tt>
    EEPROMs as giant lookup tables, each implementing a 4-bit slice of an ALU. Each ALU ROM
    accepts input via the address pins like so:
    </p>
    <table class="bit-table">
      <tr>
        <th>14</td>
        <th>13</td>
        <th>12</td>
        <th>11</td>
        <th>10</td>
        <th>9</td>
        <th>8</td>
        <th>7</td>
        <th>6</td>
        <th>5</td>
        <th>4</td>
        <th>3</td>
        <th>2</td>
        <th>1</td>
        <th>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan=5><tt>ALUOP</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Cin-MSB</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Cin-LSB</tt></td>
        <td colspan=4><tt>A</tt></td>
        <td colspan=4><tt>B</tt></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    Like the control logic, the functional concept is that each 4-bit ALU can be entirely
    described by simply iterating through all possible combinations of the 15 input bits.
    I wrote a Python program that does just this, enumerating all possible input states
    and generating the requisite output bits, which are organized as such:
    </p>
    <table class="bit-table">
      <tr>
        <th>7</td>
        <th>6</td>
        <th>5</td>
        <th>4</td>
        <th>3</td>
        <th>2</td>
        <th>1</td>
        <th>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Z</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>E</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Cout-MSB</tt></td>
        <td colspan=1><tt>Cout-LSB</tt></td>
        <td colspan=4><tt>OUT</tt></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    By accepting carry-in bits on both the high side and low side of each 4-bit slice,
    as well as outputting carry-out bits on both the high and low side, the ALU slices
    can be combined to perform 8-bit operations like left <b>and</b> right shifts. The
    "high" ALU can also be programmed subtly differently from the "low" ALU to accommodate
    things like "arithmetic" shifts that ignore the most significant bit, and special
    hard-coded bit set/reset/toggle operations that are only meant to affect the highest
    two bits.
    </p>

    <p>
    Plumbing the two ALU slices together looks like this, from my notes:
    </p>

    <p>
    The <tt>O</tt> (overflow) status is just wired to the high ALU's <tt>Cout-MSB</tt> pin.
    The <tt>E</tt> (equal) status is the AND of both ALU's equal pins.
    The <tt>Z</tt> (zero) status is the AND of both ALU's zero pins.
    </p>

    <h3>ALU Operations</h3>
    <p>
    These are the ALU operations I decided to include. Fortunately, due to the architecture
    I've chosen, I'm able to change this list any time I want!
    <ul>
      <li><tt>0x00</tt> - zero (output is <tt>0x00</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>0x01</tt> - one (output is <tt>0x01</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x02</tt> - negative one (output is <tt>0xff</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>0x03</tt> - <tt>A plus Cin_LSB</tt> (identity, used to return A or A+1)</li>
      <li><tt>0x04</tt> - <tt>B plus Cin_LSB</tt> (identity, used to return B or B+1)</li>
      <li><tt>0x05</tt> - <tt>A plus B plus Cin_LSB</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x06</tt> - <tt>A minus B minus Cin_LSB</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x07</tt> - <tt>B minus A minus Cin_LSB</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x08</tt> - <tt>A minus 1 minus Cin_LSB</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x09</tt> - <tt>B minus 1 minus Cin_LSB</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x0a</tt> - set bit <tt>0x80</tt> in A to <tt>Cin_LSB</tt> (set/clear MSB)</li>
      <li><tt>0x0b</tt> - <tt>A plus B plus Cin_LSB</tt> (overflow set using signed semantics)</li>
      <li><tt>0x0c</tt> - <tt>A minus B minus Cin_LSB</tt> (overflow set using signed semantics)</li>
      <li><tt>0x0d</tt> - <tt>B minus A minus Cin_LSB</tt> (overflow set using signed semantics)</li>
      <li><tt>0x0e</tt> - <tt>-A</tt> (2s complement inversion of A, overflow set if A is 0x80/-128, which cannot be inverted)</li>
      <li><tt>0x0f</tt> - <tt>-B</tt> (2s complement inversion of B, overflow set if B is 0x80/-128, which cannot be inverted)</li>
      <li><tt>0x10</tt> - <tt>NOT A</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x11</tt> - <tt>NOT B</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x12</tt> - <tt>A AND B</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x13</tt> - <tt>A OR B</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x14</tt> - <tt>A XOR B</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x15</tt> - <tt>A AND NOT B</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x16</tt> - <tt>B AND NOT A</tt></li>
      <li><tt>0x17</tt> - <tt>A AND 0x80</tt> (return MSB of A)</li>
      <li><tt>0x18</tt> - <tt>B AND 0x80</tt> (return MSB of B)</li>
      <li><tt>0x19</tt> - <tt>A&lt;&lt;1</tt> (new LSB set by <tt>Cin_LSB</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>0x1a</tt> - <tt>A&gt;&gt;1</tt> (new MSB set by <tt>Cin_MSB</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>0x1b</tt> - <tt>B&lt;&lt;1</tt> (new LSB set by <tt>Cin_LSB</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>0x1c</tt> - <tt>B&gt;&gt;1</tt> (new MSB set by <tt>Cin_MSB</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>0x1d</tt> - <tt>A&lt;&lt;1</tt> (arithmetic left shift, new LSB set by Cin_LSB)</li>
      <li><tt>0x1e</tt> - <tt>A&gt;&gt;1</tt> (arithmetic right shift, extends sign from MSB)</li>
      <li><tt>0x1f</tt> - <tt>Amsb XOR Bmsb</tt></li>
    </ul>
