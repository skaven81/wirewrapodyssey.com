    <h2>Software: ODY Executables</h2>
    <p>
    A huge advancement in the Odyssey was completed in early 2025, just in time
    for the 2025 <a href=https://vcfsocal.com>Vintage Computer Festival SoCal</a>.
    The Odyssey now supports running <i>executables</i> from disk, instead of
    having everything run in program ROM.  This may not sound like much, but it
    was a MASSIVE amount of work to get to this point.
    </p>
    <h3>The Problem: how to make executables work?</h3>
    <p>
    It's helpful to walk the dependency tree backward from a place where executables
    actually work, to see what needs to be done:
    <ul>
      <li>Odyssey OS shell can run executable files</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Enumerate FAT16 directories to find executable files</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Compute FAT16 offsets (clusters, directories, sectors)</li>
          <li>Interface with ATA device (read sectors given an LBA address)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Localize machine instructions to arbitrary memory locations</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Include localization data in executable</li>
          <li>Differentiate between calls to library code in ROM, and internal locations in the program</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Getting from "programs all run in ROM" to "the Odyssey boots from ROM then runs
    programs from files on disk" required significant updates to every component:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Hardware:</b> An ATA port is needed to interface with a disk drive</li>
      <li><b>Assembler:</b> The assembler has to be able to generate executable files, on top
        of its existing ability to generate raw machine code blobs for the program ROM.  The
        assembler has to seamlessly forward along memory addresses of function entrypoints
        to multiple builds across multiple files, instead of doing it all at once when
        building the program ROM.</li>
      <li><b>Operating System/BIOS:</b> The OdysseyOS has to be redesigned to function
        in terms of "booting from ROM then transitioning to disk" instead of just blindly
        starting execution at memory address <tt>0x0000</tt>. This transitions OdysseyOS
        into a system reminisicent of the IBM PC, where the BIOS (ROM) contained platform-
        specific functions for doing things like interfacing with the disk drives, keyboard,
        and display, and the BIOS's principal job on system startup was to load an OS
        from disk (such as MS-DOS <tt>COMMAND.COM</tt>) and then get out of the way.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Hardware: the ATA port</h3>
    <p>
    This is already covered in depth in the <a href='javascript:show_content("periph-ata");'>Peripherals - ATA</a>
    section. So I won't repeat that content here. What I will add for reference, however,
    is a link to the <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/ata.asm>driver code for the ATA port</a>.
    I also want to link to this excellent guide on interfacing an ATA port with an 8-bit
    computer: <a href=https://blog.retroleum.co.uk/electronics-articles/an-8-bit-ide-interface/>
    An 8-bit IDE interface @ Retroleum</a>. Also helpful was the offical ATA spec:
    <a href=https://people.freebsd.org/~imp/asiabsdcon2015/works/d2161r5-ATAATAPI_Command_Set_-_3.pdf>PDF</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some key take-aways about interfacing with an ATA port:
    <ul>
      <li>While individual bytes read and written are in the expected format with
        most-significant bit at the beginning of the byte, multi-byte formats
        (WORD, DWORD, QWORD) are in little-endian format, meaning that as you
        move through addresses in ascending order, the data is stored least-significant
        byte first. See page 15 of the ATA spec PDF linked above for a detailed diagram.</li>
      <li>All read and write operations happen in units of 512 bytes (256 16-byte
        read/write operations)</li>
      <li>Linear Block Addressing (LBA) should be supported by virtually any
        IDE device you might want to use today.  Don't bother with CHS addressing.
        However, note that LBA addresses are 28 bits (if using devices under ~128GB)
        which means your 8-bit computer has to be able to add and subtract QWORD sized
        (32-bit) numbers, which may require some tricky coding.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Ultimately, the ATA interface code I've written so far for the Odyssey only supports
    a few functions, all of which are read-only:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>:ata_identify</tt> - sends the ATA "ID" command to the drive and
        writes the 512-byte identification data to an address in memory</li>
      <li><tt>:ata_identify_string</tt> - sends the ATA "ID" command to the drive
        and returns a string identifying the type of drive. This is used during
        the boot sequence to display the attached drives.</li>
      <li><tt>:ata_read_lba</tt> - given a 28-bit LBA, sends a read command to
        the device and writes the 512-byte sector into RAM.</li>
    </ul>
    These functions (particularly <tt>:ata_read_lba</tt>) are the building blocks
    needed for making FAT16 work.
    </p>

    <h3>Software: FAT16 handling</h3>
    <p>
    After making sure I was able to detect and read reliably from attached IDE
    devices, I needed to move up one layer in the abstraction stack. This meant
    adding support for FAT16.
    </p>
    <p>
    First, I had to learn how FAT16 actually works.  Fortunately, I found this
    incredible site: <a href=http://www.maverick-os.dk/FileSystemFormats/FAT16_FileSystem.html>
    Maverick - FAT16 Filesystem</a> that explains everything in a concise and
    approachable format. Even more helpful, it includes a table of formulas used
    to compute various useful values, such as where the data region starts, where
    the root directory is located, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    The gist of how FAT16 works is that the first sector of the filesystem (which
    is LBA=0 for the Odyssey since I'm not using partitions or anything) is the
    "Boot Sector" which contains all the metadata about the filesystem itself, such
    as how many sectors per cluster, how many root directory entries there are,
    etc. Once the computer has read the boot sector, it can compute the LBA of
    any other part of the filesystem, such as the beginning of the file allocation
    table, the start of the data region, or the root directory.
    </p>
    <p>
    Everything in FAT16 other than the root directory is referenced by a 16-bit
    <i>cluster</i>. This number can be translated into an LBA address to read it
    (each cluster has multiple sectors). Once the data in a cluster is exhausted,
    the file allocation table is referenced. The cluster number can be translated
    into an offset in the file allocation table, where a word can be read that
    contains the number of the <i>next</i> cluster, or <tt>0xfff8-0xffff</tt>
    if that's the end of the file.  There are other special cluster codes in the
    file allocation table to mark empty/unused clusters, bad sectors, etc. But
    for the purposes of reading from the filesystem, all that is needed is to
    be able to start with a cluster number where the file begins, then reference
    the FAT to locate the next cluster, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
    Directories in FAT16 are 32-byte records that reside in clusters (or if root
    directory entries, in the "root directory region" which isn't actually a
    cluster, but is conventionally referred to as cluster zero). So to read a
    directory, you take the cluster number of the directory, translate that to
    an LBA, and begin reading sectors. Directory entries each contain the filename,
    file size, timestamp data, a metadata byte that indicates if the entry refers
    to a directory, a file, a volume label, etc., and (most importantly) a
    cluster number that marks the beginning of that object in the filesystem.
    </p>
    <p>
    To interface with FAT16, I had to write a ton of code:
    <ul>
      <li>Mounting a FAT16 filesystem: <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/fat16_mount.asm>fat16_mount.asm</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>:fat16_mount</tt> - given the LBA (usually zero) of a FAT16 filesystem, will
          read the boot sector, extract all the pertinent structural data, then
          pre-compute some useful data about the filesystem. A "friendly" version
          of this data is then stored in a 128-byte memory region that I call
          a "filesystem handle", and is used by most other FAT16 interface functions.</li>
        <li><tt>:fat16_print</tt> - given the address of a filesystem handle, will print
          out all the extracted data about the filesystem.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Calculating FAT16 things: <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/fat16_calc.asm>fat16_calc.asm</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>:fat16_cluster_to_lba</tt> - given a 16-bit cluster number and a filesystem handle address, returns the LBA of the cluster on disk</li>
        <li><tt>:fat16_lba_to_cluster</tt> - same as above, but in reverse</li>
        <li><tt>:fat16_next_cluster</tt> - given a 16-bit cluster number and a filesystem handle address, returns the next cluster of the file</li>
      </ul>
      <li>FAT16 directory parsing: <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/fat16_dirent.asm>fat16_dirent.asm</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>:fat16_dirent_filename</tt> - given the address of a 32-bit directory entry, returns the filename as a string</li>
        <li><tt>:fat16_dirent_attribute</tt> - same, but returns the attribute byte</li>
        <li><tt>:fat16_dirent_cluster</tt> - same, but returns the 16-bit starting cluster</li>
        <li>...plus some additional utility functions for returning a string representing a directory entry, for implementing a <tt>dir</tt> command</li>
      </ul>
      <li>FAT16 directory walking: <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/fat16_dir.asm>fat16_dir.asm</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>:fat16_dirwalk_start</tt> and <tt>:fat16_dirwalk_next</tt> and <tt>:fat16_dirwalk_end</tt> -
          given a starting cluster number of the directory, allows iteratively walking through
          a directory, with each call to <tt>:fat16_dirwalk_next</tt> returning the memory address
          of a 32-byte directory entry (which in turn can be parsed using the "dirent" functions
          above).</li>
        <li><tt>:fat16_dir_find</tt> - utility function that uses the dirwalk method above to locate
          a specific file or directory in a directory, and returns its 32-byte directory entry if
          found.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>FAT16 file reading: <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/fat16_readfile.asm>fat16_readfile.asm</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>:fat16_readfile</tt> - given the address of a filesystem handle and the address
          of a directory entry, reads the file referenced by the directory entry into memory,
          iterating through all sectors of each cluster and all clusters of the file. It uses
          the filesize in the directory entry to limit reading to the nearest 512-byte sector
          size rather than the next whole cluster.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Once I had all this code working and tested (which was no easy feat -- it took months of
    painstaking testing and analysis to make sure I was computing the correct values for all
    these jumps around in the filesystem), I was ready to start working on actually implementing
    an executable file format.
    </p>

    <h3>Assembler: ODY executable format</h3>
    <p>
    When considering how I should structure my executable file format, I wanted to keep things
    simple. So I narrowed down what I wanted to do with executables down to the smallest set
    of features I could think of that would work:
    <ol>
      <li>Executables should be able to tell the operating system that they should be loaded
        into main memory versus extended memory.  Programs that make extensive use of main memory
        might need to be loaded into extended memory, but doing so limits the ability to
        utilize extended memory (as one or both of the extended memory windows will be held
        by the running program). Meanwhile, programs that need to make use of extended memory,
        or that wouldn't fit in the 4k or 8k extended memory window, would need to reside in
        main memory.</li>
      <li>Executables must be relocatable to anywhere in memory. As the CPU executes code,
        when it encounters an instruction with an address, such as a <tt>JMP</tt> or <tt>CALL</tt>,
        the address needs to be corrected so that it points to the right location, given
        that the executable is not based at address <tt>0x0000</tt> like the ROM is. Thus
        the executable must contain a table of such addresses that need to be rewritten at
        execution time.</li>
      <li>Executables must be able to make function calls to library code that lives outside
        the program (most likely in ROM). The <tt>CALL</tt> instructions to these functions
        must not be "localized" to the executable's memory location.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    I accomplished this by adding some additional features to the <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/assembler.py>
    assembler</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>The assembler can now generate a <i>symbol table</i> which contains the memory
        offsets of important assembler features such as colon-prefixed <tt>:functions</tt>,
        <tt>$variables</tt>, and includes initialization data for the assembler so that
        assembly of some other source using that symbol table can start off as if it had
        just finished the primary (ROM) assembly.</li>
      <li>The assembler can generate an <tt>ODY</tt> executable which is really just the
        assembled machine code, prefixed with a header:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>bytes 0, 1, 2: the characters 'O', 'D', 'Y'</li>
        <li>byte 3: a "flag" byte that tells the operating system where the executable
          should be loaded into memory. This uses two bits, with six bits remaining for
          future features as needed.</li>
        <li>bytes 4-5: a 16-bit word containing the number of address rewrites needed
          in the program. This is the length of the array starting at byte 6, and may be zero.</li>
        <li>bytes 6+: any address rewrites are encoded as 16-bit words in this section.
          The value in each item in the array is the offset in the machine code where
          an address rewrite is needed. When the operating system seeks to that offset
          in the program, it will find a "zero-based" offset already present. That value
          is to be read, and the address of the first byte of the program added, with the
          resulting value written back to that location.</li>
        <li>The machine code for the program follows the address rewrite array.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    With the assembler able to write <tt>ODY</tt> files, a corresponding set of library
    functions were written into the operating system code in <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/fat16_odyexe.asm>
    fat16_odyexe.asm</a>.
    <ul>
      <li><tt>:fat16_inspect_ody</tt> - reads the first 6 bytes of a file and makes sure that
        it is actually an ODY executable. Returns the flag byte so the OS can allocate memory
        at the right location for the rest of the executable.</li>
      <li><tt>:fat16_localize_ody</tt> - once the OS has loaded the entire executable into
        memory (using the <tt>:fat16_readfile</tt> function above) this function is called
        to perform the address rewrites in the executable. When done, it returns the
        address of the first byte of the program, which can be used with the <tt>CALL_D</tt>
        instruction to call the program.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Operating System: OdysseyOS redesign</h3>
    <p>
    With all the above tooling in place, the operating system could be rewritten to behave
    more like a typical computer, where it boots initially from ROM, then transfers control
    of the system to an operating system which resides on disk. The boot sequence, which is
    in <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/00-main.asm>00-main.asm</a>,
    performs the following steps:
    <ol>
      <li>Initialize core system functions, such as initializing the memory allocator, the
        heap, and the interrput vectors</li>
      <li>Performs an extended memory test</li>
      <li>Probes the ATA bus for attached devices</li>
      <li>Allocates global memory regions to store filesystem handles for devices 0 (master) and 1 (slave) on the ATA bus</li>
      <li>Mounts drive 0 on the ATA bus</li>
      <li>Looks for a file named <tt>SYSTEM.ODY</tt> in the root directory of the drive</li>
      <li>Loads the file into memory, performs ODY relocation, and executes it</li>
    </ol>
    This sequence means that the BIOS/ROM no longer needs code in it for any commands, a shell,
    or anything other than the static sequence of "booting" the machine. Everything else can
    be in <tt>SYSTEM.ODY</tt>. However, since RAM is scarce and ROM is already there, the ROM
    still contains all of the <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/tree/master/assembler/os_shell/lib>
    library code</a> so that ODY executables don't have to include it themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/tree/master/assembler/os_shell/system><tt>SYSTEM.ODY</tt></a>
    executable is really just a slight rework of the same shell code I was using before in the
    early ROM-only versions of the OdysseyOS. It will get improvements over time, but the
    important thing is that instead of all the commands it can execute being compiled into one giant
    monolithic binary, I can now break all those commands out into their own ODY executables that
    are stored on disk alongside <tt>SYSTEM.ODY</tt>.  The <tt>SYSTEM.ODY</tt> shell itself has
    code so that typing a command that isn't one of the built-ins, results in a scan of the
    filesystem to locate an ODY file that matches the command name.  If found, that executable
    is loaded and executed, just like the BIOS loaded and executed <tt>SYSTEM.ODY</tt> itself.
    Due to the nature of nested <tt>CALL</tt> instructions, it's possible to return from an
    executable with a simple <tt>RET</tt> instruction, returning control back to the OdysseyOS
    shell in <tt>SYSTEM.ODY</tt>.
