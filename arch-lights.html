    <h2>Architecture: Blinkenlights</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    Every good electronics project needs some blinking lights, right?
    I debated whether I should add LEDs to the board that would show things
    like control signal states, register values, and bus states. At MHz
    clock speeds, anything visible in the LEDs would be a blur too fast
    to make any sense of.
    </p>
    <p>
    But I decided that it just wasn't a proper homebrew computer project
    if I didn't at least have <i>some</i> lights, so I decided to add
    visualization for the address and data buses.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
    It's a very simple setup. I have three LED bars, each with ten LEDs.
    I only use eight LEDs from each one. The data and address buses are fed
    into three <tt>74HC245</tt> bus transceivers (because I had them handy)
    and the outputs of the transceivers go directly into the LED anode. The
    LED cathodes go into 330 ohm resistors (in a DIP network) for current
    limiting purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <tt>74HC245</tt> can push around 20-30mA per output; with a 330
    ohm resistor and 5 volts that's 15mA, and the displays are sufficiently
    bright.
    </p>

    <h3>But are they useful?</h3>
    <p>
    Surprisingly, yes! It turns out that there are certain states that the
    CPU can get into, where being able to see the bus activity clearly indicates
    that something has gone wrong (or that the CPU is still working correctly).
    </p>
    <p>
    In particular, the opcode for the <tt>HLT</tt> is <tt>0xff</tt>, so if
    I see the data bus just sitting there with all 8 LEDs fully lit, and
    the program seems to have done what I expected, then I can reasonably assume
    that the program ran as I expected (up to the <tt>HLT</tt> instruction)
    without having to dig out the logic analyzer.
    </p>
    <p>
    It also turns out that many operations, even something fast like processing
    a keystroke, cause an easily apparent flash on the LED bars as the program
    jumps to another part of memory. The LED bars look decidedly different while
    processing the keystroke than they do in the idle loop waiting for an interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
    All said, I'm glad I added them to the board.
