    <h2>Video Card: Hsync &amp; Vsync Generation</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    In this section I'll discuss how the video card generates the Hsync and Vsync signals. These signals are
    the only ones the monitor uses to determine the the resolution and refresh rate. The approach used to
    generate these signals is identical to <a href="https://eater.net/vga">Ben Eater's breadboard video card</a>.

    Here's the timing requirements, from <a href=http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/640x480@60Hz">TinyVGA.com</a>,

    <h3>Display configuration and timing theory</h3>
    <p>
    The Odyssey video card only displays 64 8-pixel-wide characters per row. Each character is 8 pixels
    tall, making for 60 rows of characters on a 640x480 display. 64 characters per row is only 512 pixels
    though, meaning there are 128 extra horizontal pixels that are unused, 64 on each side of the displayed
    content.
    </p>
    <p>
    I find it's best to think about how the video card works, by using the position of the electron beam
    scanning across the display as the reference point.  As it moves across each line, a horizontal pixel
    counter is incrementing as each new pixel appears under the electron beam. When the beam reaches the
    end of the line, a horizontal sync pulse is generated, and the electron beam moves back to the beginning
    of the line, which causes the vertical line counter to increment.
    </p>
    <p>
    With a horizontal (column) count and a vertical (row) count, it is possible to use these counts to trigger
    different behaviors at the precise right times to sync with the monitor. I'll talk about the character
    and color generation in other sections. Here I'll just talk about the Hsync and Vsync signals. This
    is the first milestone when building a video card - once you can generate the Hsync and Vsync signals with
    the correct timing, your monitor will sync and report back to you that it is receiving a 640x480 60Hz
    signal, though there will be no image yet.
    </p>

    <h3>Generating the Hsync signal</h3>
    <p>
    The pixel clock is defined by the spec as 25.175MHz.  So I use a can oscillator to generate
    that exact frequency as the primary clock signal.  This signal is then fed into a 16-bit
    synchronous counter built with <tt>74F161</tt> counters. I had to use the "F" series of
    chips as "HC" logic does not work at 20+MHz speeds. Everything after the horizontal counter
    runs at small fractions of the 25MHz pixel clock, and so HC logic can be used there.
    A series of <tt>74x30</tt> 8-bit NAND gates are used to identify various values
    in the pixel clock counter and generate signals when those values are present. The
    horizontal counter is zero 8 pixels to the left of
    <ul>
      <li><b>7</b> and <b>519</b> - marks the beginning and end the viewable area. It starts at 7,
          because the font ROM takes a non-trivial amount of time (several pixels) to load the first
          character of the line into a register. So we actually start the character generation process
          8 pixels early, to get the first character and color bytes loaded into the registers and ready
          for the first displayable column. Then 519-7=512 pixels later, we turn mark the end of the
          viewable area. The <tt>/HDRAW</tt> signal is thus pulled low during the time when the
          electron beam scans across the 512 viewable pixels in a given row, and is high otherwise.
          Note that <tt>/HDRAW</tt> is not a VGA signal, it's used inside the Odyssey video card to
          prevent it from generating a non-zero pixel output outside the 512x480 drawable area.</li>
      <li><b>600</b> and <b>696</b> - marks the beginning and end of the horizontal sync pulse. The
          way this is computed is that "0" marks 8 pixels to the left of the display area. Then
          520 pixels go by (512+8), and then 64 pixels (584) to get to the right edge of the visible
          area (column 640 of the physical display). The "front porch" is 16 pixels wide, which
          takes us to 584+16=600, when the Hsync pulse should start.  The Hsync pulse is 96 pixels
          wide, so we reset Hsync at 600+96=696.</li>
      <li><b>799</b> - The "back porch" adds another 48 pixels, 696+48=744, then we have another
          56 (64-8) pixels before we reset the horizontal counter back to zero, which marks the
          beginning of the display area (minus eight pixels).</li>
    </ul>
    The Hsync signal itself is generated by a <tt>/S/R</tt> latch - that's a super simple type of
    latch, where a low pulse to the <tt>/S</tt> input causes the latch to be "set" (pulled low),
    while a low pulse to the </tt>/R</tt> input causes the latch to be "reset" (pulled high). Using
    a latch allows creation of a low pulse that lasts for dozens or hundreds of clock ticks, without
    needing complex combinatorial logic to match that exact set of numbers on the horizontal counter.
    Just match the start number and pulse the <tt>/S</tt> line, then match the end number and pulse
    the <tt>/R</tt> line.
    </p>

    <h3>Generating the Vsync signal</h3>
    <p>
    The Vsync signal is generated precisely the same way as the Hsync signal, only instead of using
    the pixel clock and the primary counter input, the Hsync signal itself is used as the counter
    input. That allows the counter to count the number of rows drawn, starting at zero. Just like
    the horizontal sync generation, there are four sets of NAND counter matchers that detect the
    start and end of the drawable area as well as the start and end of the Vsync pulse. A fifth
    matcher checks for the last line and resets the counter back to zero when the electron beam
    is back to the top of the display.
    <ul>
      <li><b>0</b> - when the vertical counter is at zero, the electron beam is on the first viewable
            (and drawable) line on the display. So <tt>/VDRAW</tt> gets asserted (set) when the vertical
            counter is reset.</li>
      <li><b>480</b> - after 480 lines have been drawn, <tt>/VDRAW</tt> is reset, as we are now outside
            the drawable area. This ensures the pixel output is always low when outside the drawable area.</li>
      <li><b>490</b> - 10 lines later we've covered the front porch and and <tt>/VSYNC</tt> is pulled
            low by pulsing <tt>/S</tt> on its <tt>/S/R</tt> latch.</li>
      <li><b>492</b> - The Vsync pulse is only 2 lines long, so at 492 we pulse <tt>/R</tt> on the
            <tt>/VSYNC</tt> <tt>/S/R</tt> latch to bring it high again.</li>
      <li><b>525</b> - The back porch takes another 33 lines, which brings us to 525, at which point
            the vertical counter is reset, which puts us back at the top line of the viewable area.</li>
    </ul>
