		I don't really have any social media presence or anything. I'm not a YouTube creator
		and I don't have a Twitter/X account. I'm not on the Fediverse. If you have any questions
    or comments and want to get in touch with me, your best bet is to shoot me an e-mail:

    I sometimes post YouTube videos <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Wbyvj0HaUoAp8v_uKcDmA">here</a>,
    but I don't really maintain a "channel" or post new videos regularly or anything.

    You can find the github repository for the Wire Wrap Odyssey <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu">here</a>.
