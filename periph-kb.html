    <h2>Peripherals: Keyboard</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The keyboard peripheral is one of the places I took some liberties with the "all 7400-series
    logic" design element of the Odyssey computer (the other is in using a fancy dual-port RAM
    for main memory). When I considered how I wanted to handle keyboard input, I started by watching
    Ben Eater's video series where he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aXbh9VUB3U" target=_blank>
    interfaces with a PS/2 keyboard using simple shift registers</a>, and then later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1SB9Ry8_Jg">
    builds interface hardware for a 6502 CPU</a> for a PS/2 keyboard. These videos, and some
    Google searches here and there, familiarized me sufficiently with the PS/2 protocol that
    I was able to get started.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the key things I found, was that when you press the <tt>a</tt> key on your keyboard,
    the <i>scancode</i> sent by the keyboard, doesn't have any relation to the ASCII 'a' character.
    There are also extended scancodes and all sorts of funky internal state to track. Further,
    the PS/2 protocol is bi-directional: the host computer is actually responsible for turning
    the numlock, capslock, and scroll lock LEDs on and off.
    </p>
    <p>
    I was thus faced with a challenge. If I went the Ben Eater route and interfaced a keyboard
    directly to the Odyssey CPU, my interrupt handler would need to do all of this translation
    between scancodes and ASCII codes, as well as handle the difference between make and break
    events, and also know how to deal with capslock and shift! Not only would it be a substantial
    amount of complex code to write in Odyssey assembler, it would also be rather long (especially
    the giant case statement to translate scancodes into ASCII values).
    </p>
    <p>
    So I decided to offload all of this work to the peripheral itself. The "keyboard peripheral"
    would talk to the PS/2 keyboard on its own, and handle all the make/break events and read
    all the scancodes. The peripheral would handle setting the LEDs, handling shifting and capslock,
    and translating scancodes to ASCII characters. The Odyssey CPU would just see a couple 8-bit
    registers: one containing an ASCII character, and the other containing eight flags indicating
    whether the shift, control, alt, or other special keys were currently held down. The flags
    register also says whether the keystroke was a make (key press) or break (key release).
    </p>

    <h3>Keyboard controller implementation</h3>
    <p>
    I decided to put the whole keyboard controller into an ATTiny85 microcontroller, which is
    a miniscule 8-pin device with 5 volt I/O pins. This is just enough I/O, as PS/2 interface
    needs two, output to a pair of shift registers takes two more, and another output is needed
    to signal an interrupt.  That's five GPIO pins, with the sixth pin being the microcontroller's
    reset input, and then of course ground and Vcc to round out the eight pins.

    <p>
    I used the Arduino bootloader to ease development, and you can find the source code
    <a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/keyboard_controller_attiny/keyboard_controller_attiny.ino" target=_blank>
    here</a>. With some research, I found that modern PS/2 keyboards can support three different
    scancode sets. Scancode set 3, the most recent one, is the simplest, with every key on a
    typical 104-key keyboard represented with a single eight bit scancode. This is opposed to
    the more complex set 1 and 2, which have many keys that send multiple scancodes, and use
    a funky "extended scancode" marker, which requires the controller to track state over time.
    </p>
    <p>
    On boot, the ATTiny85 initializes the attached PS/2 keyboard by sending it a reset command,
    then puts the keyboard into PS/2 mode 3 (so it begins sending scancodes from scancode set 3).
    It then does some useful configuration like making sure typematic mode is disabled on keys
    like shift and control. It sets the keyboard LEDs and then begins watching the PS/2 port
    for keypresses.
    </p>
    <p>
    When a key is pressed (or released) on the keyboard, the scancode is read in by the ATTiny85,
    and appropriate action is taken. For special keys like capslock and numlock, all that
    happens is that the internal state of the program gets updated and the LEDs get updated
    to reflect the new state. For normal keys, the scancode is 
    <a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/keyboard_controller_attiny/scancode_to_ascii.h" target=_blank>
    translated to an ASCII code</a> and then the ASCII code, plus the current set of flags,
    is shifted out to a pair of '595 shift registers. Once shifting is complete, the controller
    pulses an IRQ request line low. A <tt>/S/R</tt> latch is used outside the controller to
    make the IRQ signal stay low; it is reset by the address decoder, so that when address
    <tt>0xc00x</tt> appears on the address bus, the IRQ is cleared.
    </p>

    <h3>Keyboard to CPU interface</h3>
    <p>
    The keyboard controller handles all the complexity of talking to the keyboard and handling
    the PS/2 scancodes. The CPU can read from two registers:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>0xc000</tt> - ASCII code for the last keystroke (or <tt>0x00</tt> for make/break events on control keys</li>
      <li><tt>0xc001</tt> - Keyboard flags:
      <ul>
        <li><tt>0x01</tt> - 0=make, 1=break</li>
        <li><tt>0x02</tt> - CTRL pressed</li>
        <li><tt>0x04</tt> - ALT pressed</li>
        <li><tt>0x08</tt> - F-key pressed (if this flag is set, the 0-9/!/@ in the key register indicates which F-key was pressed)</li>
        <li><tt>0x10</tt> - SHIFT pressed</li>
        <li><tt>0x20</tt> - NUMLOCK is active</li>
        <li><tt>0x40</tt> - CAPSLOCK is active</li>
        <li><tt>0x80</tt> - SCROLLOCK is active</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    When a keystroke (or key release) occurs, the keyboard controller will pulse the
    <tt>/CPU_INT</tt> signal low (see the diagram above). This causes the <tt>/S/R</tt>
    latch to pull the <tt>/IRQ1</tt> signal low, and hold it there.  When the CPU accesses
    either the flags or keystroke register, the <tt>/S/R</tt> latch is reset, which
    allows the <tt>/IRQ1</tt> signal to return high.
    </p>

    <h3>Keyboard interrupt handler</h3>
    <p>
    When the OS wants the keyboard to become active, it can set the IRQ1 handler to
    the <a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/keyboard.asm#L55" target=_blank>
    <tt>:kb_irq_buf</tt></a> function. This function takes each keystroke and appends
    it to a buffer. Programs can use access functions (<a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/keyboard.asm#L81"><tt>:kb_bufsize</tt></a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/keyboard.asm#L94"><tt>:kb_readbuf</tt></a>)
    to read from the buffer. This way keystrokes can be processed even if the CPU is busy doing
    other things, and extra keystrokes will be buffered until the program can read them.
