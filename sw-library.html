    <h2>Software: OS Library</h2>
    <p>
    As much work as it has been, the physical construction and verification of the
    Odyssey computer is only half the battle. In order to make a computer that is
    actually usable and not just a "toy", it needs to have an operating system of
    sorts, so that different programs can be executed, storage can be browsed,
    and data saved and retrieved.
    </p>
    <p>
    Early 8-bit computers accomplished this in different ways, but as I was most
    familiar with the x86 series of computers growing up, I was most familiar with
    the concept of a BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). The idea is that common
    functions for interacting with the hardware, such as printing to the display,
    interfacing with the serial port, allocating memory, and browsing attached
    storage devices, were all provided by the hardware itself in ROM. Software
    written for such systems did not need to implement their own drivers for the
    hardware: all they had to do was set some CPU registers and trigger an interrupt,
    or perhaps directly call a function in ROM.
    </p>
    <p>
    I've taken a similar approach, but extended it to also include the operating
    system shell (in DOS this would be <tt>COMMAND.COM</tt>) in ROM as well. So
    the computer can be booted without any external storage. Which is handy, as
    at this point I don't have any storage interface yet!
    </p>
    <p>
    The <a href=https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/tree/master/os_shell/lib>OS Library</a>
    has been built up little by little, without much of a "master plan" to coordinate
    it. As I added new hardware functions to the CPU and computer, I'd write small
    test programs and a library to validate that the hardware was working correctly,
    then move on to the next construction task. The result of this is a bit of a
    mess, but it's a mess that actually seems to work OK for now.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once I finished principal construction, I started working on the OS shell. This
    was mostly because as I started adding more peripherals, having the ability to
    test their behavior using simple <tt>peek</tt> and <tt>poke</tt> commands comes
    in really handy. And so that's more or less where I started -- I started building
    up an OS shell environment that could intitialize the CPU and peripherals to
    sane defaults, run some power-on self test (POST) checks, and drop into an
    interactive shell. I made sure the shell would behave in an expected way, with
    the left and right arrow keys, backspace and delete, all functioning as expected.
    I also made sure that the console could scroll as programs output text beyond
    the last line of the display.
    </p>
    <p>
    Getting to this point took a surprising amount of code. I have an even deeper
    respect for the '70s and '80s hackers that managed to cram all of this functionality
    (and more!) into just a few KB of ROM and RAM back in the day.  As it stands,
    my "improvisational" and "just in time" approach to building all this stuff
    has made for some pretty inefficient code, and at the moment the BIOS functions
    and shell consume nearly 12KiB of ROM. Since the entire ROM is only 16KiB,
    I expect that I'll have to go back and do some refactoring pretty soon. But maybe
    I'll get lucky and manage to get the ATA port drivers and FAT16 interface functions
    crammed into that last 4KiB, which will allow me to start offloading any new
    code into external binaries stored on removable media.
