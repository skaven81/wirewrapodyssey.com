    <h2>Software Overview</h2>
    <p>
    There are three major blocks of software that had to be implemented to make
    the Wire Wrap Odyssey work.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('sw-alu')">ALU Generation</a> - The Odyssey
        ALU (arithmetic logic unit) is implemented as a LUT (look up table) in two ROMs.
        Each ROM implements a 4-bit ALU, and two are combined to implement an 8-bit ALU.
        Since the ALU is the "brain" of any CPU, it is critical that all ALU operations
        function precisely and that all edge cases are accounted for. The ALU Generation
        code performs exhaustive testing of all ALU operations, and generates the ROM
        binary images. A simulator was also implemented so that ALU operations could be
        tested without needing to flash a test program to the Odyssey program ROM.</li>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('sw-assembler')">Assembler</a> - The assembler
        code consists of a stack of programs that collectively define the microcode and
        program code of the Odyssey CPU. The CPU's control circuitry is abstracted into
        configuration files that can be easily modified should the CPU's hardware implementation
        change. These configuration files are then used to generate a human-readable
        microcode syntax, which in turn is used to define the CPU's opcode behavior.
        The assembler then reads the opcode specification to generate a parser for assembly
        files, which are processed into machine code that is written to the CPU's program ROM.</li>
      <li><a href="javascript:show_content('sw-library')">OS Library</a> - With a functional
        assembler, the abstraction moves up another layer by implementing Odyssey assembly
        library functions to perform basic tasks like clearing the screen, implementing
        a cursor and moving it around the display, interfacing with peripherals like the
        keyboard and serial port, and allocating memory. These OS library functions roll
        up to a top-level shell program, which forms the frontend of the OdysseyOS.</li>
