    <h2>Peripherals: RTC &amp; Timer</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The real time clock (RTC) and timer functions are a staple of most computers, especially those
    of the 8-bit and 16-bit era. And the vast majority of those computers used the venerable
    Dallas DS12887 RTC chip. The Wire Wrap Odyssey includes a modern version of that chip, the
    <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ds1501-ds1511.pdf">
    Maxim DS1511Y</a>. It has some modern amenities that the DS12887 does not, such as an internal
    integrated 32.767kHz crystal, a watchdog timer, and 256 bytes of battery-backed SRAM.
    </p>

    <h3>Why add an RTC &amp; timer?</h3>
    <p>
    There are three key functionalities enabled by adding the DS1511Y to the Odyssey:
    <ol>
      <li>256 bytes of battery-backed SRAM to store settings/options across reboots</li>
      <li>Clock stuff - read out the time and date, and measure the passage of time without having to count clock ticks</li>
      <li>Generate interrupts at defined, precise intervals</li>
    </ol>
    #3 is of the most direct use, particularly when programming something like a game.
    I can set the RTC to generate an interrupt as often as every 10 milliseconds. So for
    example I can set it for a 33 millisecond interval and every time the interrupt fires,
    redraw the screen and move the player sprites one time step. It doesn't matter what
    the CPU clock speed is, the sprites will always move at the desired speed across
    the screen.
    </p>

    <h3>Interfacing to the DS1511Y</h3>
    <p>
    Like most 8-bit-friendly peripheral chips, the DS1511Y interfaces with a host CPU
    with a set of address pins (5 address bits in this case), and 8 data pins connected
    to the data bus. It has chip select, output enable, and write enable pins just like a RAM.
    And so it's interfaced with the system by allocating it some address space and using
    some simple glue logic to do address decoding

    <p>
    The address decoding ensures that the DS1511Y is selected (<tt>/CS</tt> goes low) when
    the address is in the <tt>0xc080-0xc0ff</tt> range.  The lowest five address pins are
    wired directly to the chip, so addresses <tt>0xc080-0xc09f</tt> are mapped to the chip's
    <tt>0x00-0x1f</tt> addresses. As a result, manipulating the DS1511Y from code is
    simple, just read and write to specific memory addresses.
    </p>

    <h3>Timer interrupts</h3>
    <p>
    I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/skaven81/mycpu/blob/master/assembler/os_shell/lib/timer.asm">library</a>
    that allows easy access to the DS1511Y's interrupt functionality. Like most peripheral
    devices that can generate an interrupt, the interrupt is cleared when reading one of the
    control registers (control register A in this case). To test this behavior out, I implemented
    a <tt>:sleep</tt> function in the library. All it has to do is:
    <ul>
      <li>write 0 to <tt class=register>AL</tt></li>
      <li>set the IRQ3 vector to a function that writes 1 to the <tt class=register>AL</tt> register and reads the control register to clear the interrupt</li>
      <li>Write the appropriate control registers to enable the timer for the requested amount of time</li>
      <li>Go into a tight loop waiting for <tt class=register>AL</tt> to be non-zero</li>
    </ul>
    A similar approach can be taken to refresh the display in a game context. The game code
    can point the IRQ3 vector to a fuction that performs the display refresh, and clears the
    IRQ. The timer can be configured to reset and go again once it generates an interrupt (versus
    the <tt>:sleep</tt> function which performs a "one-shot" interrupt). Each time the timer
    fires, the display refresh function will execute, perfectly on time. The main game code
    can break out of this behavior by updating the timer control register to disable the
    timer interrupts, and restore the IRQ3 vector to a no-op function that just clears the
    interrupt.
