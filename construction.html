    <h3>Why wire wrap?</h3>
    <p>
    To answer this, let's look at why <i>not</i> some of the alternatives.
    </p>
    <h4>Breadboards</h4>
    <p>
    Breadboards are inexpensive and very accessible. All the wiring is on the
    top side, so it's easier to get the wiring right, particuarly when prototyping.
    And with custom-cut solid core wire and some clever wire routing, bread board
    designs can be quite elegant and reasonably simple to maintain.
    <a href=https://austinmorlan.com/posts/8bit_breadboard/>Here's a good example
    of an 8-bit CPU on a breadboard</a>. It doesn't look too bad.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, there are lots of downsides with breadboards for a project like
    this, that relegates breadboard-based designs to the "toy" category.
    <ul>
      <li>Breadboards have very low component density. Look at the photos in the
      link above. the whole computer is nearly as large as the Odyssey, but only
      has around 50 chips. By comparison, the Odyssey has nearly 150 chips! Wire
      wrap prototyping boards are 2-4x denser than breadboards.</li>
      <li>Breadboards have a lot of parasitic capacitance. This severely limits
      signaling speeds, and thus clockspeed. Breadboard CPUs tend to run well
      under 1MHz clock speeds to stay stable. Wire wrap prototyping boards have
      solid power and ground planes and high quality pin connections. Decoupling
      capacitors are easy to bind to a nearby ground. The Odyssey runs just
      fine at nearly 3MHz, and is limited mostly by signal propagation than
      parasitic capacitance.</li>
      <li>The connections on a breadboard are spring-fit and do not hold the
      wires particularly tightly. Working on a breadboard with lots of wires
      can often cause some wires to get inadvertently pulled out. Additionally,
      corrosion can cause poor connections, especially in the cheaper breadboards
      that don't have gold plated terminals. Wire wrap, on the other hand, is
      incredibly reliable. According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wrap>
      Wikipedia</a>, <i>Wire wrap construction can produce assemblies that are
      more reliable than printed circuits: connections are less prone to fail
      due to vibration or physical stresses on the base board, and the lack of
      solder eliminates soldering faults such as corrosion, cold joints and dry
      joints. The connections themselves are firmer and have lower electrical
      resistance due to cold welding of the wire to the terminal post at the
      corners.</i>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Printed Circuit Boards</h4>
    <p>
    PCBs is how all the cool kids are prototyping these days. With shops like
    PCBWay able to turn out professionally printed circuit boards for just a
    few tens of dollars, it makes perfect sense to take advantage of the reliability,
    speed, and quality of a PCB when building a big complex project like this.
    So why did I use wire wrap instead?
    </p>
    <p>
    Well, the biggest disadvantage (for me, at least) with using PCBs is that
    everything has to be designed upfront. The whole computer has to be designed
    and laid out using CAD software, then sent off to the PCB shop, and then
    the boards come back and get assembled and tested. It's <i>efficient</i>,
    but for me, it doesn't sound like a lot of fun. Since I built the Odyssey
    as a hobby project, I didn't want to have to worry about having everything
    all decided up front. I had a lot more fun just throwing chips onto a board
    and hacking on it for a weekend to get an idea to work (or not). That's
    not possible with PCB design.
    </p>

    <h4>Perfboard / Stripboard</h4>
    <p>
    This approach seems like the best balance between durability/reliability and
    "hack it together" fun of prototyping. And in fact I was so convinced of that
    when I first started building the Odyssey, that this is precisely what I did.
    I purchased plated perfboards and would spend hours soldering 30 gauge wires
    point to point on the back of the board to implement an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
    This works fine for small projects. But as the complexity grew, it became
    increasingly daunting to have to solder all these wires. And when soldering,
    any pins that have mutliple wires attached become extremely difficult to
    deal with, as every time you melt the solder, the other wire(s) want to move
    around.
    </p>
    <p>
    It turns out that our forebears already solved this problem with wire wrap
    prototyping. It solves the durability/reliability problem while retaining
    the density of a PCB or perfboard construction. And multiple nets are easy
    to attach to a single wire wrap pin without disturbing existing wiring. It's
    even relatively easy to make repairs -- often it's just a matter of cutting
    out the offending wire (leaving the dead wraps on either end) and wrapping
    a new wire to fix it. The posts are tall and can accommodate a few mistakes.
    </p>

    <h3>Wire Wrap Supplies</h3>
    <h4>Prototyping boards</h4>
    <p>
    I gravitated toward professional wire wrap prototyping boards. These were
    likely hideously expensive when they were originally made and used in the
    1970s and 1980s. But these days you can pick them up on eBay for 50-200
    dollars. That might sound like a lot compared to a bunch of breadboards, but
    note that it's a LOT more prototyping space than a breadboard, and the finished
    product will be a lot more reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
    On eBay, I find that searching "augat prototyping board" brings up good
    matches. Augat is a brand name of prototyping board. There are others, but
    Augat seems to have the best quality boards that I've found.
    </p>
    <p>
    Prototyping boards will typically have columns of wire wrap posts set
    0.3" apart (the standard width of a DIP chip), with 50 pins in each column.
    There will be a power plane on one side and a ground plane on the other,
    with wire wrap posts set every 8-10 pins. Most prototyping boards have
    some kind of external interface -- I'm sure many were designed to plug into
    a big backplane.
    </p>

    <h4>Wire wrapping wire</h4>
    <p>
    I have used many different types of wire wrapping wire, but the best by far
    is 30 gauge Kynar insulated wire. All the big shops like Jameco, Mouser,
    Digikey, etc. sell it. Just search for "Kynar" and filter to 30 gauge wire.
    </p>

    <h4>Wire wrapping tools</h4>
    <p>
    The pros back in the day would use a wire wrapping gun <a href=https://www.specialized.net/tools/wire-wrap-tools/wire-wrap-guns.html>
    like this</a>. I probably should have picked one of these up early on, but
    instead I've gotten along well with <a href=https://www.amazon.com/JAMECO-BENCHPRO-30AWG-Wire-Wrap/dp/B00C9NWR1Q>one of these</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I also use a 30 gauge wire stripper, a tiny flathead screwdriver I use for
    pushing wires around on the board, and a good pair of tweezers.
    </p>

    <h3>Wire Wrap Technique</h3>
    <p>
    This is probably best taught via a YouTube video. Bil Herd has a great
    introduction that he did for Hackaday:
    <iframe width="560" height="315"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXvEDM-m9CE?si=O_lsnXBogFcAnZ1k"

            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
            allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
    Personally, the only tip I can really think of is to not apply too much pressure
    on the wrapping tool. Only the slightest pressure (barely more than the weight of the
    tool itself) should be applied to the pin when spinning the tool to wrap the pin.
    If you apply too much pressure, it causes overwrap, which is not only ugly, it can
    also lead to broken bits of wire falling off and causing shorts in the project.
