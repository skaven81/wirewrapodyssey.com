    <h2>Architecture: Clock &amp; Reset Generation</h2>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
    The clock signal is the beating heart of any digital project like this, and
    so it is important that the clock signal be strong and clean, with sharp edges
    and a consistent frequency. Additionally, the clock signal on a project like
    the Odyssey requires that it be tunable across a wide range of frequencies, to
    aid in both detection and mitigation of signal propagation timing issues.
    </p>
    <p>
    The reset signal might sound trivial, but it's actually really important to
    set up properly. My professor in my computer architecture class in college once
    quipped that "coming out of reset is the hardest part of building a CPU". If
    you think about it, that makes sense. Every stateful component in the system
    must be able to reset to a known-good state (which isn't necessarily "all zeroes")
    when the <tt>/RST</tt> signal is asserted. And what happens if <tt>/RST</tt>
    were to bounce? It needs to be asserted long enough for the whole CPU to properly
    reset. And then what about coming <i>out</i> of reset? The reset signal needs
    to be synchronized with the clock so that coming out of reset happens just as
    predictably as everything else.
    </p>

    <h3>Clock Signal</h3>
    <p>
    In early prototypes, I used a 32.768kHz watch crystal fed into a ripple counter,
    with a multiplexer used to select from a collection of frequency divisions.
    I also incorporated a mechanism to provide a manual clock, as I figured this
    would be helpful for troubleshooting. My first attempt was built on protoboard
    using point-to-point soldering.

    When I later rebooted the project, after building the video card on wire wrap
    board, I needed to re-implement the clock and reset unit. But this time, I had
    firsthand experience with troubleshooting the video card, which has a 25MHz
    clock, and found that since I had a logic analyzer, single-stepping using a switch
    on the board was really unnecessary. And that clock speeds of 1MHz or more would
    be desirable, if I wanted performance similar to the 6502-based Commodore 64 or
    Apple ][ computers.
    </p>
    <p>
    With these new requirements in mind, I searched the 7400-series of chips and came
    across the <tt>74x624</tt>, a voltage-controlled oscillator. With this chip I could
    use a potentiometer to generate a 0-5v variable signal, and feed that into one
    of the pins on the chip, and the output would scale accordingly. A "range" input
    allowed me to fix the frequency range to a band that would be appropriate for this
    project.

    <p>
    The '624 VCO was fed with a 2.5v signal to the <tt>RNG</tt> (range) input, by simply pairing a couple
    10k resistors into a voltage divider. The <tt>FC</tt> (frequency control) input is fed through a similar
    voltage divider, only one half of the divider is a 50k 10-turn trim pot. According to the '624 datasheet,
    if <tt>RNG</tt> is 2.5v, then the output frequency would scale from about 1MHz when <tt>FC</tt> is near
    0v, up to about 12MHz when <tt>FC</tt> is near 5v. This primary clock output is then fed through
    a D flip-flop to reduce the frequency in half and ensure a nice clean square wave. Finally that signal
    (and its inverse) is fed into some inverters that act as buffers, so the output signal for the rest
    of the board is as strong as possible. The final result is that I can scale the clock from about
    500kHz up to about 6MHz by adjusting the trimpot on the board, and I see a very clean and sharp square
    wave on my oscilloscope across the full frequency band.
    </p>

    <h3>Reset Signal</h3>
    <p>
    Next is the <tt>/RST</tt> signal. There are a few requirements:
    <ul>
    <li>When the reset button is released, the <tt>/RST</tt> signal must only return to a high level
        on a rising clock edge</li>
    <li>Once <tt>/RST</tt> goes low, it must stay low for at least a full clock cycle</li>
    <li><tt>/RST</tt> should be low on initial power-up and stay low long enough for the system to
        stabilize (e.g. all the capacitors charge) before being de-asserted automatically</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Ensuring the first condition is accomplished by having the reset button input go into the
    input of a D flip-flop, which is tied to the clock.  The output of the D flip-flop will only change
    on rising clock edges, satisfying the first condition.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second condition I kind of ignored, as when you're talking about clock frequencies in the MHz range,
    it's not actually possible to toggle a button fast enough to cause a reset pulse small enough to cause
    problems. And even if it did happen by chance, I could just press the reset button again. No big deal.
    </p>
    <p>
    The third condition is satisfied by adding an RC circuit to the reset button, so that on powerup,
    the capacitor is discharged and thus holds the signal low as the system powers up. Once the capacitor
    is sufficiently charged (through a resistor), the voltage rises high enough to allow the reset signal
    to be de-asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the netlist/diagram above, you can see the reset circuitry drawn out in the top-right corner of the
    page. The reset button is tied to ground, and tied up with a 10k pull-up resistor. A second 10k resistor
    is paired with an 0.1uF capacitor to form the RC circuit. With 20k of resistance, the time constant is
    2ms, which is plenty of time for the rest of the circuit to come up to speed. The output of the RC
    circuit (and the pull-down reset button) goes into a schmitt trigger inverter. A schmitt trigger will
    switch from high to low (or vice versa) at different voltages, which prevents a slowly rising (or falling)
    input signal from causing a high frequency "flapping" output. As the schmitt trigger's input voltage
    rises over (for example) 3.5v, it will switch its output to low.  But as the input voltage goes back down,
    it has to go below (for example) 1.5v before its output will switch to high.
    </p>
    <p>
    The D flip-flop takes the <tt>CLK</tt> signal, ensuring that the output signals only change on a
    rising clock edge. The output from the D flip-flop is the <tt>/RST</tt> signal, and conveniently,
    flip flops provide an inverted output so I get <tt>RST</tt> (an inverted reset signal) for free.
    </p>
    <div class="tip-container">
      <b>Note:</b> throughout my schematics and netlists, I <i>consistently</i> use <tt>/RST</tt> and <tt>RST</tt>
      incorrectly. Anywhere I use <tt>RST</tt> it means "the active-low reset signal", and <tt>/RST</tt>
      is "the active-high reset signal". I still, to this day, have no clue why I did that, but once I had
      a few pages of notes with the signals backwards, I just had to stick with it. Many regrets.
