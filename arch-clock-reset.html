    <h2>Architecture: Clock &amp; Reset Generation</h2>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
    The clock signal is the beating heart of any digital project like this, and
    so it is important that the clock signal be strong and clean, with sharp edges
    and a consistent frequency. Additionally, the clock signal on a project like
    the Odyssey requires that it be tunable across a wide range of frequencies, to
    aid in both detection and mitigation of signal propagation timing issues.
    </p>
    <p>
    The reset signal might sound trivial, but it's actually really important to
    set up properly. My professor in my computer architecture class in college once
    quipped that "coming out of reset is the hardest part of building a CPU". If
    you think about it, that makes sense. Every stateful component in the system
    must be able to reset to a known-good state (which isn't necessarily "all zeroes")
    when the <tt>/RST</tt> signal is asserted. And what happens if <tt>/RST</tt>
    were to bounce? It needs to be asserted long enough for the whole CPU to properly
    reset. And then what about coming <i>out</i> of reset? The reset signal needs
    to be synchronized with the clock so that coming out of reset happens just as
    predictably as everything else.
    </p>

    <h3>Clock Signal</h3>
    <p>
    In early prototypes, I used a 32.768kHz watch crystal fed into a ripple counter,
    with a multiplexer used to select from a collection of frequency divisions.
    I also incorporated a mechanism to provide a manual clock, as I figured this
    would be helpful for troubleshooting. My first attempt was built on protoboard
    using point-to-point soldering.

    <p>
    When I later rebooted the project, after building the video card on wire wrap
    board, I needed to re-implement the clock and reset unit. But this time, I had
    firsthand experience with troubleshooting the video card, which has a 25MHz
    clock, and found that since I had a logic analyzer, single-stepping using a switch
    on the board was really unnecessary. And that clock speeds of 1MHz or more would
    be desirable, if I wanted performance similar to the 6502-based Commodore 64 or
    Apple ][ computers.
    </p>
    <p>
    With these new requirements in mind, I searched the 7400-series of chips and came
    across the <tt>74x624</tt>, a voltage-controlled oscillator. With this chip I could
    use a potentiometer to generate a 0-5v variable signal, and feed that into one
    of the pins on the chip, and the output would scale accordingly. A "range" input
    allowed me to fix the frequency range to a band that would be appropriate for this
    project.

    <p>
    The '624 VCO was fed with a 2.5v signal to the <tt>RNG</tt> (range) input, by simply pairing a couple
    10k resistors into a voltage divider. The <tt>FC</tt> (frequency control) input is fed through a similar
    voltage divider, only one half of the divider is a 50k 10-turn trim pot. According to the '624 datasheet,
    if <tt>RNG</tt> is 2.5v, then the output frequency would scale from about 1MHz when <tt>FC</tt> is near
    0v, up to about 12MHz when <tt>FC</tt> is near 5v. This primary clock output is then fed through
    a D flip-flop to reduce the frequency in half and ensure a nice clean square wave. Finally that signal
    (and its inverse) is fed into some inverters that act as buffers, so the output signal for the rest
    of the board is as strong as possible. The final result is that I can scale the clock from about
    500kHz up to about 6MHz by adjusting the trimpot on the board, and I see a very clean and sharp square
    wave on my oscilloscope across the full frequency band.
    </p>

    <h3>Updated Clock Signal</h3>
    <p>
    In March 2024, I made a pretty significant change to the clock signal.  I observed that most of the
    time that the clock was low, was wasted.  When the clock transitions from low to high, that's when
    all the action happens, and state changes propagate throughout the board.  Then when the clock
    transitions from high to low, most of the memory devices treat that as a "commit" trigger.  Then
    the clock sits for a while in the low state, and upon the next low-to-high transition, a few other
    devices treat that as a "commit" trigger.
    </p>
    <p>
    With a typical 50% duty cycle clock, the propagation delay after the low-to-high transition, before
    the next high-to-low transition, is my limiting factor.  With <tt>HC</tt> logic, that appeared to
    put me somewhere around 1.4 to 1.8 MHz as my maximum clock speed.  Not bad, but it could be better.
    </p>
    <p>
    So I replaced the clock with an updated design that generates a 75% duty cycle, using the design
    described in <a href=https://www.radiolocman.com/shem/schematics.html?di=64117>this blog post</a>.
    I only use one NAND gate (and it's not a Schmitt trigger model), as I only need the 75% duty
    cycle output, and my clock input is coming from the <tt>74x624</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The method of operation is pretty straightforward. The two D-flip-flops are chained together
    as a 2-bit counter, in such a way that propagation delays guarantee that the output NAND gate
    will not glitch on the <tt>0b01</tt> to <tt>0b010</tt> transition. The clock is high for
    <tt>0b00</tt>, <tt>0b01</tt>, and <tt>0b10</tt>, then transitions low on <tt>0b11</tt>. The result
    is a perfect 75% duty cycle clock.
    </p>
    <p>
    I did run into some problems when I first implemented it.  I have a few places
    on the board that use flip-flops to synchronize asynchronous write pulses to the clock, and those
    flip-flops use the <tt>/CLK</tt> (inverted clock) signal as well as the <tt>CLK</tt> (uninverted
    clock) signal. The circuits glitch if the <tt>/CLK</tt> transitions happen before the <tt>CLK</tt>
    signal transitions. And when I first implemented the new 75% duty cycle clock, I was using an
    inverter as a buffer, meaning the "primary" clock was actually <tt>/CLK</tt>, which was inverted
    again to generate <tt>CLK</tt>.  This didn't work.  So I had to do some rewiring to ensure that
    the primary clock was "first", then inverted to generate <tt>/CLK</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
    If I were doing this all again from scratch, I would come up with a more comprehensive solution
    for clock generation and distribution, and perhaps implement two clocks that are somewhat
    out of phase with each other, to have a more reliable way of generating asynchronous write pulses
    at the edges of the clock, without needing so much support circuitry around each module.
    </p>

    <h3>Reset Signal</h3>
    <p>
    Next is the <tt>/RST</tt> signal. There are a few requirements:
    <ul>
    <li>When the reset button is released, the <tt>/RST</tt> signal must only return to a high level
        on a rising clock edge</li>
    <li>Once <tt>/RST</tt> goes low, it must stay low for at least a full clock cycle</li>
    <li><tt>/RST</tt> should be low on initial power-up and stay low long enough for the system to
        stabilize (e.g. all the capacitors charge) before being de-asserted automatically</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Ensuring the first condition is accomplished by having the reset button input go into the
    input of a D flip-flop, which is tied to the clock.  The output of the D flip-flop will only change
    on rising clock edges, satisfying the first condition.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second condition I kind of ignored, as when you're talking about clock frequencies in the MHz range,
    it's not actually possible to toggle a button fast enough to cause a reset pulse small enough to cause
    problems. And even if it did happen by chance, I could just press the reset button again. No big deal.
    </p>
    <p>
    The third condition is satisfied by adding an RC circuit to the reset button, so that on powerup,
    the capacitor is discharged and thus holds the signal low as the system powers up. Once the capacitor
    is sufficiently charged (through a resistor), the voltage rises high enough to allow the reset signal
    to be de-asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the netlist/diagram above, you can see the reset circuitry drawn out in the top-right corner of the
    page. The reset button is tied to ground, and tied up with a 10k pull-up resistor. A second 10k resistor
    is paired with an 0.1uF capacitor to form the RC circuit. With 20k of resistance, the time constant is
    2ms, which is plenty of time for the rest of the circuit to come up to speed. The output of the RC
    circuit (and the pull-down reset button) goes into a schmitt trigger inverter. A schmitt trigger will
    switch from high to low (or vice versa) at different voltages, which prevents a slowly rising (or falling)
    input signal from causing a high frequency "flapping" output. As the schmitt trigger's input voltage
    rises over (for example) 3.5v, it will switch its output to low.  But as the input voltage goes back down,
    it has to go below (for example) 1.5v before its output will switch to high.
    </p>
    <p>
    The D flip-flop takes the <tt>CLK</tt> signal, ensuring that the output signals only change on a
    rising clock edge. The output from the D flip-flop is the <tt>/RST</tt> signal, and conveniently,
    flip flops provide an inverted output so I get <tt>RST</tt> (an inverted reset signal) for free.
    </p>
    <div class="tip-container">
      <b>Note:</b> throughout my schematics and netlists, I <i>consistently</i> use <tt>/RST</tt> and <tt>RST</tt>
      incorrectly. Anywhere I use <tt>RST</tt> it means "the active-low reset signal", and <tt>/RST</tt>
      is "the active-high reset signal". I still, to this day, have no clue why I did that, but once I had
      a few pages of notes with the signals backwards, I just had to stick with it. Many regrets.
