    <h2>Architecture: Program Counter</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The program counter is really just a 16-bit register, that stores the address
    of the current instruction. Functionally, it needs to be able to load different
    addresses, and it would be helpful if it could also be incremented automatically
    without needing to involve the ALU. As I was building the Odyssey, this was the
    first unit I constructed after the clock and reset unit, meaning there was no
    ALU, no memory bus -- literally nothing else. So it had to operate independently
    of other units and control signals at this early stage.
    </p>

    <h3>Control Signal Design</h3>
    <p>
    The behavior of the program counter can be distilled down to the following behaviors:
    <ul>
    <li>Do nothing</li> 
    <li>Increment</li>
    <li>Load a new address from the data bus</li>
    <li>Present the PC address to the address bus</li>
    </ul>
    I found that the <tt>74x161</tt> synchronous 4-bit counters with parallel load would
    work well for the program counter register. The outputs of the '161 counters are fed into some
    <tt>74x245</tt> bus transceivers, to allow control of whether the PC value should be
    presented to the address bus. And the '161 has control signals to indicate whether
    the data presented to the four input lines should be loaded on the next rising clock
    edge. Conveniently, the '161 also has an asynchronous clear input that allows resetting
    the counter to zero any time.
    </p>
    <p>
    Since it would be convenient to be able to present the register value to the address
    bus (or not) separately from determining whether the register should be preloaded with
    new data from the address bus or incremented on the next clock edge, I broke out the
    control signals into two pairs, resulting in the following truth tables:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>PCRSEL 00</tt> - do nothing</li>
    <li><tt>PCRSEL 01</tt> - <tt class=register>PC</tt> presented to address bus</li>
    <li><tt>PCRSEL 10</tt> - <tt class=register>PCL</tt> presented to data bus</li>
    <li><tt>PCRSEL 11</tt> - <tt class=register>PCH</tt> presented to data bus</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li><tt>PCWSEL 00</tt> - do nothing</li>
    <li><tt>PCWSEL 01</tt> - Increment <tt class=register>PC</tt></li>
    <li><tt>PCWSEL 10</tt> - Write data bus to <tt class=register>PCL</tt></li>
    <li><tt>PCWSEL 11</tt> - Write data bus to <tt class=register>PCH</tt></li>
    </ul>
    These signals were chosen somewhat strategically.
    </p>
    <p>
    First, using <tt>00</tt> to mean "do nothing" makes it easier to establish
    default behavior, by using pull-down resistors on the signal lines. This
    allows the circuit in test to be powered up and have the clock running, but
    nothing happening. I can then trigger behavior by pulling a signal high (even
    just by touching a 5v wire to the appropriate pin) and have that trigger the
    logic analyzer so I can observe the behavior of the outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
    Second, observe that the operations that deal with 8-bit hi/lo values use the
    same bit pattern. Both are placed where the high bit of the control signal is
    high, and that allows the low bit of the control signal to be mapped directly
    to the hi/lo register circuitry.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
    Below you can see my notes for lining up the signals for the various chips.

    <p>
    The rightmost page in the notes shows how everthing is glued together. The '161
    counters are on the left and form a synchronous 16-bit counter. The outputs
    are fed into two '245 bus transceivers which can be enabled to present the full
    16-bit value to the address bus. The counter outputs are also fed into a pair of
    '257 selectors, which can place either the high 8-bits or low 8-bits on the data
    bus (or go into a hi-z state when neither are selected).
    </p>
    <p>
    The glue logic for the <tt>PCRSEL</tt> and <tt>PCWSEL</tt> signals provide
    the control inputs, such as the <tt>/OE</tt> (output enable) signals for
    the '245s and the <tt>/LOAD</tt> signals for the '161s.
    </p>
    <p>
    The resulting implementation on the wire-wrap board consumes columns C/D (the '161
    counters) and E/F (the '245s and '257s for presenting to the buses).
